## Dashboard Approach

For French dashboard, we can:

1. **Display all reviews** with language indicators
2. **Show original language** in the UI
3. **Run sentiment analysis on originals** (works best with our current keywords)
4. **Add language filter** so users can focus on French reviews

This avoids translation costs while still providing insights.
