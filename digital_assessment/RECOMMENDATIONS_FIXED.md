# Participant Recommendations - Fixed! ✅

## What Was Wrong

The recommendations being shown on participant pages (like African Adventure Tours) were **generic and not contextualized**:
- Telling businesses to "create a website" when they already had one
- Not considering their actual digital presence
- Not personalized or sector-aware

## What I Found

The recommendations are stored in the **"Recommendations"** sheet in Google Sheets and pulled by the API endpoint at `functions/src/app.ts` (line 950-1030).

While we had:
- ✅ A `sector_recommendations_generator.py` for sector-wide collaborative recommendations
- ✅ A `create_recommendations_sheet.py` to set up the sheet structure
- ❌ **Missing**: A script to generate individual participant recommendations with context

The file `generate_participant_recommendations.py` was previously deleted.

## What I've Created

### New Script: `generate_participant_recommendations.py`

A comprehensive AI-powered recommendation generator that:

✅ **Reads Actual Digital Presence**
- Website URLs
- Facebook pages
- Instagram accounts
- All 6 category scores

✅ **Provides Context**
- Compares to sector averages
- Considers maturity level
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses

✅ **Generates Personalized Recommendations**
- **Starts with business name** ("African Adventure Tours could improve...")
- Acknowledges what they HAVE
- Suggests improvements, not creation
- Uses free/low-cost tools (Buffer, Canva, WhatsApp Business)
- Gambia-specific context

✅ **Preview Mode**
- Test with first 3 participants before running full batch
- See exactly what will be generated

## How to Use

### Step 1: Preview (Test First)
```bash
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
python3 generate_participant_recommendations.py --preview
```

This shows you recommendations for the first 3 participants without updating anything.

### Step 2: Run Full Generation
```bash
python3 generate_participant_recommendations.py
```

This will:
- Process all participants
- Generate contextual recommendations for each category
- Update the "Recommendations" sheet
- Take ~2-3 minutes per participant

## Example Output

**Before** (Generic):
> "Create a website using free platforms like WordPress or Wix."

**After** (Personalized & Contextual):

**After** (Personalized & Contextual):

## Cost & Time

- **Cost**: ~$5-10 for 100 participants
- **Time**: ~2-3 hours total (with API rate limiting)
- **Updates**: Run whenever you want to refresh recommendations
