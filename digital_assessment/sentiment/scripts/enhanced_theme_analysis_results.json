        "ask for a try before you buy  agree a price and get them to walk with you for 10 mins  and let them show you the birds you'll soon know what you've got  you can go it alone as it is difficult to get lost just follow the path but the good guide will show you so much more than you'll see going it alone and are well worth the 400d fee for their services",
