Access to the upper floors can be made through a series of several marble spiral stairs.  Although there is an elevator it was not working.\n\nEach floor provides a panorama of the city, with the top floor providing a view extending to the sea port of Banjul and the mangrove forests of Tanbi Wetland Complex.

The displays in the natural history and agriculture sections are poor by any standards, consisting of poorly framed and fading photographs and a few skins.\nThe reconstructed settlement of the 19th century is much better and was made more interesting by the guide who accompanied me. \nHowever you would be hard put to spend more than an hour here. I was soon in the central bar/entertainment area where a drum band was playing (for me). All a bit uncomfortable and although I would like to have helped by spending some money there was no 'shop' or even any craft souvenirs available. A lack of funding is clearly a problem and such efforts to promote Gambian culture can only be commended and supported- just don't expect much. But in time things should change.",

Gambia, here I come!",

It is on the lefthand side of the road with the sea to the right.\n You can rent one of their round houses if you wish. (Simple, basic, and inexpensive allowing free entry to the museum whilst staying) \n Admission 200 dalasi and well worth it. The large grounds contain many indigenous plant. There are demonstrations of traditional crafts many items are available at fixed prices. The guides are knowledgeable and informative.\n Finish your visit in their Bantaba, perhaps with some refreshments listening to local museums",

The “pool” is just a few seconds walk from the museum and it is “free” as it is included in museum fee. I am seriously against to touching while animals and make me sad that so many people taking “cool” photos while “sitting” on crocodiles. \nThere are 3 parts … one where you can go to crocodiles very close and touch them. Pool where you can’t go close to them as they are aggressive (well that’s their nature right?) and then where you can see babies.  I have had great guy to talk to and we were joking and talking not just about crocodiles but life generally. You can contribute some money if you wish to keep this place running and I think it’s worth it",

There is a moderately-interesting museum near the top and you certainly get some good views over the town and surrounding countryside.

The arch itself is not in great condition, and if we remember right, the entrance fee was 50 dalasi per person.\nA museum is located half way up the arch, which displays Gambian culture before their  independence from Great Britain. Once up on the balcony of the arch, you now have a great view of the city of Banjul. if you have been to the city of Banjul, then you will know that the place is nothing special. But the views overlooking the city are great. Different stories are being told at every angle of your view, so take advantage because you won't have a better opportunity! At least the president has given the tourists a positive side of Banjul....",

You can't experience that at the hotels. \n\nThen we arrived at a small museum where we learned about The Gambia. And after that we meet the reptiles. It's crazy how close you can get to these beasts. \nBut it's very safe and the owners are there to comfort you, haha. \nI can really recommend this trip. \n\nAnd i want to give a big shoutout to our new friend JoJo. He made our Gambian vacation a lot better.\nIf you want to experience The Gambia i really recommend you guys to contact JoJo.",

It's a small area but it's impressively clean and the stones seem to be well maintained. My guide said that it was maintained by the community and they are eager to share stories of the stones. It was interesting to learn about the area's history but be aware that the guide will speak at length, so let him know if you have any time constraints.\n\nPerhaps it was a miscommunication, but my guide said that he was a volunteer. I left a tip, but my driver said that they are paid. I'm not sure which was accurate.\n\nI would recommend a stop if you're in the area. I was a bit on the fence about going, but I'm glad that I did. It was something different to see in this region of Africa.\n\n",

We had a good stop here and also had a drink and lunch . We did notice a lot of the tours were just using it as a toilet stop and didn’t give the opportunity that we did with our tour guide, we saw some people that wanted to learn more but wasn’t allowed as it was a flyby for them, if this happened to myself and my husband I would of been so angry as you need to get to hear the history to understand the stones.\nIf you get the opportunity to visit this amazing place please take your time to talk to the stone man as his knowledge just wowed me. What I couldn’t get my head around was that all of the stones are in the sun but if you touch one it will be really hot and then another one will be cold .\nIt’s Gambia’s very own Stonehenge .",

          "text": "We drove from Farafenni to Wassu (Farafenni is about 3 hours away from the Kombo/Serrukunda, including a crossing at Barra). The journey took us about 2 - 2.5 hours. We made the mistake of not leaving for Wassu at crack of dawn, so the heat in the car was unbearable (no air con).\n\nWassu is a UNESCO site with several ancient stone circles that, according to the guide, are older than our Stonehenge -  5,000 to 7,000 years old (the building of these circles happened over 1,500 years).\n\nThe circles are in fact burial  mounds for kings and high ranking chiefs and only one circle has been dug, in the 1960s. Due to local beliefs and respect the other circles have not been excavated.\n\nThere is a very good and informative small museum on site (see my photos), and we could even get a cold beer. In the middle of no-where, in a country where electricity is a luxury, that was a very special treat.\n\nThe entry fee is small however unclear (the ticket stipulates one number but the guide charges more - I think for their services). It does not matter, we are talking peanuts, up to 300 GMD for two people.\n\nStunning special place. The stones themselves are beautiful, and to think that they are over 5,000 years old is mind blowing.\n\nI strongly recommend visiting Wassu, either by hiring a car or by organised tour from the Kombo. There are not many roads in the Gambia so it is very unlikely that one will get lost. It is 1,000% safe, the people are lovely and friendly.\n\nIt is not a big site but I needed more than an hour to cover the site, to see each circle and to take photos and videos to capture this beautiful site. However my husband, who was distracted terribly by the heat, would have been happy with a 30 minutes slot to cover the whole site.\n\nThe pile of small stones on the stones is a sign of respect from visitors.\n\nLast note - even though this is a UNSECO site, unlike Stonehenge, visitors can access each corner of the site and touch the stones freely.",

A weaver making cloth the traditionally way.  A reconstructed tradional hutted Village.  Entertainment in a cafe/ resting area by two drummers.\n\nThen went on to the fishing area by the shore.  Saw fish being smoked. Then the boats came in laden with fish.  It’s very busy with folk (mostly women, but guys with wheelbarrows) collecting the catch.  It got extremely crowded (but not as pungently awful as the smoking area).\n\nAn interesting experience.",

          "text": "My visit to Kunta Kinteh Island was excellent. I've visited a few slave trade sites in West Africa, but this one was different. I was the only tourist there and, although it was dilapidated, it felt very authentic. There are a few points of information throughout the island that provide some background and it's quite impactful to walk around the small island itself.\n\nI would recommend a guide / driver as there are a few steps to the journey of getting there, especially from the Serrekunda area. Once we arrived, a local guide took the boat with us and escorted me around the island. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. I had read that the island is being impacted by climate change, and the local guide said that efforts are being made to restrict any impact. I hope that these efforts are a priority as this island should definitely be preserved. There is a museum on the mainland which is informative, but I believe that a fee is required to take photos.\n\nI would recommend a visit to Kunte Kinteh Island to anyone visiting Gambia. I learned a lot there and really appreciated the knowledge from my guide and the museum.",

          "text": "This is an interesting and important place to visit on a trip to Gambia. However, a word of warning, the journey to get there is long (took us 10 hours there and back through there was a problem with the ferry so might be 8 on a good day). We went with a guide to make things easier, though you could figure it out yourself if you wanted. We were staying on the coast in the beach resorts (Kololi/Senegambia). First you drive to Banjul. Then get the ferry to Barra (not very regular, maybe 1 every 1.5 hours, takes about 30 minutes to cross). Then another taxi to the museum (this leg will be easier soon as they're halfway through tarmacing the road). Then a pirogue boat to the island where a guide (with not great English) will show you around for about 30/40 minutes. Then you visit the small museum about the slave trade, which is interesting but a bit basic, again 30/40 minutes. The guide charged us £80 for the day for 2 people (including lunch and water) and then we had to pay another £33 for the museum/island/pirogue. Then tips for all the guides and drivers. I expect we were overcharged and while it's a good place to visit, and the ferry and pirogue were also good experiences, I don't think it was worth it in terms of the cost and time travelling.",

If you love leaves, knock yourself out.\nThere’s a crocodile pool where you won’t see crocodiles.\nThere’s an ‘education centre’ where a man will ask for maintenance donations stood next to a couple of torn posters that haven’t been replaced in 30 years. And of course, next to all this non-learning, there is an ‘opportunity’ to buy stuff you don’t want.\nThen more walking until finally you get to the world’s most depressing zoo - where they’ll tell you some thoroughly unconvincing nonsense about why these baboons needed to be in an enclosure rather than just free. Clearly just an excuse to get tourists there and to have them buy peanuts to feed them with. Felt really sorry for them.\nAnd there’s the three pens with hyenas and vultures co-existing (emphasis on ‘existing’). \nCan’t see how anyone but the most ardent fauna and bird fan (not that we saw many of those either) could get anything out of this place.

The stairs up there were very low, so be careful with your head if u are a bit taller (I’m 5.11 and had to duck a few times lol...)\n\nAlso be careful in one of the rooms there was a large square hole in the floor into the room below, with no balustrade around. \n\nMost of the exhibits seemed very old and dusty but it was interesting to read the informative boards of the Gambian history etc, it didn’t seem very looked after though which was a shame.\nThere was no one apart from me and my friend up there and no staff available. \nThere had been a restaurant up there we were told but this had moved down to a small adjacent park which didn’t seem very busy.\n\nNice views from the upper floors though so interesting to see.\nLuckily we had a torch with us though as when walking down the second set of stairs was in complete darkness ...

          "text": "This is a good reserve if you are really interested in exploring the nature and go without any set expectations.  There is no point going there just to tick the box on the places you visited.  You need a proper, experienced and knowledgable guide with you to enjoy this park.  I do not recommend taking \"any\" guide at the park as most of them are useless.  Also do not go in large groups as you will scare the animals out and will only be able to see the ones in the cage.  You need to have a lot of patience and stamina to walk for at least 90 minutes.  The best time to visit is in the morning when the sun is not heavy on you.  We went during the rainy season so it was a different experience altogether.  However, the walking paths were a bit muddy and we had to be extra careful but we thoroughly enjoyed our outing.  We had an excellent guide with us who was very knowledgable and knew everything about the park.  He was our private guide, not costly at all.  If you are visiting this country then spend a little extra it will be worth the experience you get compared to others.  We saw many beautiful birds on our way as well lot of red monkeys.  They are very shy of humans so make sure you do not make any noise when you spot them.  It is a treasure to see them jumping from the tree branches or just sitting over there.  We spotted two chameleons and our guide said that you must very lucky to have them.  He got one of them before it ran away and put them on a stick and handed it over to us.  We could see it changing colors before we let it go free in the wild and had enough of pictures with it.  The experience with Hyena was great as well as this was the first time I saw them and so close.  They do look dangerous but we had a \nRanger protecting us while we take our picture with them having behind us in the close proximity.  The Rangers will be quite supportive if you go with a known guide and that is the difference.  They too will share lot of knowledge with you.  Eventually, you need to be friendly and taking interest and then everything else will automatically fall in place.  Don't be like another tourist.",

Banjul is one store city, so it is a topmost point from where you can take nice shots and views to all city. Please, mind that elevators inside the column are usually broken, so you will need to climb up the spiral steps  to the top. For old people it can be hard task. There is a state museum inside with an information about The Gambia history. It is quite interesting/ I hope they will soon replace an exposition honoring their \"great\" doctor professor academic state savior etc. etc. former president mr. Jammeh, who was 20 years holding power robbing The Gambia so extensive, that after he was pushed out by Senegal forces in 2017, the State Treasury  appeared empty with last few millions of dollars transferred during  the last days of his presidency out of the country/ He even did not forget to take with him his luxury cars - god knows where he suppose to drive them in the Africa mostly without roads....",

You are walking amongst sellers and buyers and the 'streets' are really narrow which makes it easy to get claustrophobia. taking pictues is really hard here because being so narrow the sellers do notice you taking a pic which they don't like at all. So be aware that they shout towards you or even are taking something to throw at you. \n\nWe did it wit our guide Mamadi from Checkpoint Charlie tours. No stress, his task is to protect and serve and even walking at amongst the fishers on the beach gave you a save feeling. Don't forget to do that too. \n\nIt's dirty and smelly, count on that but what a joy to visit.",

          "text": "As much as I wanted to visit Abuko I was almost put off by some of the things said in the negative reviews but we were booking some bird watching trips with a bird guide and he assured us it was an important place to visit. He was not wrong! \nOur very informative guide, Musa Manneh (+220) 7834098, showed us a total of 51 different species of wonderful colourful and spectacular birds that day along with an abundance of information about the various plant, insect and animal species we were seeing along our walk. Although he predominantly a bird guide he is very knowledgeable about the natural history of Gambia and will give insights into the local culture too. \nIt is very evident to me that the way to get the best out of this place is to arrange with someone who understands it to take you there. Avoid booking a trip with a mini bus full of people, you will disturb any wildlife as the mass of people tramp through the well trod paths of the reserve. Individual guiding is not as expensive as you might imagine in The Gambia and it pays massive dividends in how much it improves your experience of these places. You only have limited time during your holiday so why waste it by handing a poultry sum to a bumster who will walk with you but not give you any insight or understanding to the things you are seeing and not help you to see the things that prefer not to be seen! \nDuring our time there so many people walked right past us as we were standing watching some magnificent bird, once or twice people would stop to look in the direction I was pointing my camera lens and we would point out what we were seeing. \nA guide you have employed to take you there will ensure you avoid unwelcome advances from the bumsters and ensure you are proceeding at a pace that suits your stamina and ability, at least that is what we experienced with Musa. \nWe set off early so we could avoid being there at the hottest time of the day. Musa also took us to explore an area of paddy fields opposite the reserve before we went in and that area was simply amazing. If anyone wished to book him before they leave home then they can do so via email musaamanneh56@yahoo.com and you can find his website by typing Musa Manneh Bird Watching Tours into your search engine. The man is a gentleman who will provide a car with a very safe driver and take great care of you, he speaks perfect English too.",

A wonderful opportunity to find out and get up close to these fascinating animals.\nThey are well cared for and happy to tolerate humans as they are well fed. Do listen to the guide as some pregnant crops will not be so happy to be approached. \nGreat local information in  series of rooms on the way in about tribes, musical instruments, and info about military history.\nEntrance fee 100 D and an opportunity to leave a contribution to help towards food for the crops. \n",

Babu's office is in a street kiosk directly in front of the Ocean Bay Hotel in Bakau. Babu took us on a walk around Bakau to see some sights we were interested in. We went to the National Botanical Gardens, where Babu organised for us to tour the gardens with the Director of the gardens, who explained the plant species we were viewing and the relevance of the plants to the Gambia ecology and economy. Babu then took us to the Bakau Community School and onwards to the Katchikally Crocodile Pool. Babu gave us a guided tour of the museum at the pool and then the pool itself. He is a very knowledgeable guide with excellent English. Babu said we would have the opportunity to stroke the crocodiles, but what he hadn't told us was that they are free to roam the grounds. At first we found this a little alarming, but the pool guide explained that the crocodiles were fed every morning and that they would then not be interested in people unless disturbed. Indeed, all the crocodiles were sunning themselves and quite amenable to being stroked....carefully. The purpose of the pool and the crocodiles was explained to us and its continuing importance in Gambian folklore and society. All in all an excellent and interesting trip.",

It is easy to find your way around the parc, a guide is really not needed, so I would save the money next time.",

The reptiles were practically comatose, now bearing in mind that they are cold blooded creatures, they should have been very lively indeed in a temperature of 34-36 degrees. When questioned about the state of their inertia we were told that they have been trained to only perceive fish as food, which l am sorry to say was a complete and utter load of Croc! They were undoubtedly sedated which was very sad to see and l and 1 other in our group refused to participate in such a farce.",

Interesting beak from hotel/pool/beach. \n\nThe Negatives:\nThe merchandise is very tourist oriented and the best prices you can get here are much higher than you can get elsewhere. Some stall holders are too pushy - once you show even the slightest interest it is hard to get away without buying something. \n\nOverall, it is an interesting place to visit, but if you have the time, it is much better to visit Banjul market where you will find a much wider authentic range and get lower prices.

Our guide also assisted us in taking photographs - the locals were not keen on the camera - but he stopped at a few stalls and bought some fresh ingredients for his evening meal - as he got into conversation with the stall holders we were then able to take some candid shots without offending. \nIt's a warren of narrow allies, some stalls covered with bright sun umbrellas and some stalls in the covered market. All sorts on sale from the enormous smoked fish being sold from a wheel barrow to Sunday dresses and flip flops. Of course the usual fruit and veg. \nIt's even possible to have a shirt tailor-made - several guys working away at their sewing machines at the back of the market. \nWe spent half an hour here - could have easily stayed longer",

We were also able to browse at our leisure without any of the usual requests to look in every stall. We've been lucky to see many similar markets around the world and always find it very interesting (once we've put aside our squeamishness!!) to watch how local people shop and what for. Our driver was stunned when he showed me the huge baskets full of oysters and I told him how much oysters can cost back home.",

          "text": "I probably chose one of the worst times to visit the market this year as it was rainy season, so the heat was pretty unbearable. Not the first time I have been to the market, and it surprises me every time I go. A very busy place, lots of items on offer from jewellery to cloth, watches to clothes and shoes. Please be cautious though it is very easy to get lost and with the heat dehydrated as well. The place is sprawling and if you don't take a trusted guide you will probably not enjoy it so much. It is quite an experience to visit such a busy place, but please be careful, the streets are a bit rough and you can lose yourself quite easily. I would advise not taking young children there as them getting lost could be a real problem. Take water and if you can find a trusted guide from one of the more well know hotels then take them also. You will find that once guided properly around you can enjoy some of the wonderful wares on offer, and also the prices, (if you haggle a bit then the prices can be really good). The atmosphere is pretty amazing, its just so busy and to be fair most people are friendly. Overall an experience that sometimes I enjoy, but when it is this hot not so much. \nJust remember: Take water\n                          Take a guide\n                          Don't take young children\n                          Use your common sense when dealing with people",

He took us to lots of interesting stalls and it was fun battering with the stall holders who were all so friendly. Pity about the rubbish everywhere but this was typical of The Gambia. Put up with it and the place is so interesting. We saw school children, having finished school, learning the trade of making the colourful clothes worn in The Gambia and even smaller children carrying trays of water contained in small clear plastic bags which added to the rubbish. Noisy and cheerful. A great experience",

Within minutes we had seen a dozen or more species I'd never seen before and over the three hours I was there, he was helpful, friendly and informative.

Admission to the reserve is very cheap but a guide will cost you about £20 upwards, depending how long you want to stay.

However, we booked a last minute day trip - and this was included so I decided to brave it. I wasn’t aware of the museum at the start so that was nice and very interesting addition. Particularly enjoyed the instruments which our guide said I was allowed to have a go on. On the walk from the museum to the crocodile pond there’s a very interesting tree trunk formation which you can walk inside. Don’t miss it. I was so busy walking and talking to the guide I didn’t realise til I was right upon the crocodiles! I thought my heart would stop. They were laying across the bank, motionless with their mouths wide opened (this is how they cool off). There were some others with their mouth closed and the pool guide invited us to come stroke them. It took me over 15 minutes of coercion to gently touch one with my finger. The guides are really good, patient and knowledgeable. There’s a little gift shop there. I found it impossible to relax at all whilst there as I was so scarred but once I’d left a sense of adrenaline overcame me and I couldn’t believe I had braved it. Guide took a great photo of the inside of one of the opened mouths. Good, clean toilet.",

The little museum was interesting - our guide explained about the musical instruments and tribal culture and then you go to see the pool which is still considered sacred by the locals.  I would question the taking of tourist pictures with the crocs on the bank and suspect that the creatures are doped up in some way to make them docile and allow people to get up close to them.  There were hordes of people milling around when we were there which seemed a little surreal.  Worth seeing for the experience but like I say, I do question the photo taking......",

          "text": "The town of Bakau, just 12 km from Banjul, the capital of The Gambia, hosts an interesting site.  A pool with crocodiles, which inexplicably allow themselves to be touched and petted.  The pool is named Kachikally (also Katchically or Katchikali) and belongs to the Bojang family which has been administering it for 500ish years.\n\nThe site is promoted to be a sacred pool in which barren women can bath to wash away whatever has been holding them back from conceiving.  After performing the sacred ritual bathing, she is told to remain faithful to her husband and not to shake hands with other men for a year.  Faithfully adherence should bring her a child.  Required elements of the ritual includes bringing “a humble petition” of “Kola-nuts and other small offers” to the Bojang family.\n\nEntering, I was met by a guide who collected my entrance fee and led me about a hundred yards to the pool (after I suggested that I would visit the museum at the entrance at the end of my visit).  The pool and its surrounds are a kind of oasis in the middle of the town.  The approximately 9 acre site is surrounded by trees and swamp-like growth and you quickly forget that you are in the middle of a populous town.  Right in front of the pool lie the main attractions, 2 meter long crocodiles sunning themselves with their mouths wide open (which is their way of keeping cool).  I was the only visitor at the time, but it was startling to see several guides seated just 8-10 feet from these reptiles which strike such fear in southern US States and which generate headlines when their encounters go horribly bad for locals (and often their pets) caught by surprise. \n\nI took a step closer, and then another one.  Then there I was, bending over and petting a live crocodile, smiling at the camera as my guide took my picture.\n\nAs I said, I can’t explain why I became complacent.  It just seemed perfectly natural to wander around the crocodiles, touching them, asking questions, and staring into their gapping, tooth filled mouths.  Their semi-catatonic state made me think that perhaps they were sleeping (though their eyes were open and eerily followed you as you moved around).  I asked my guide about this, and he smiled again (in fact, I think he never quit smiling).  He asked me to get my video camera ready.  He said that they were always alert, and ready to pounce on food to which they would be alerted based on the vibration it would make when it hit the ground.  Sure enough, he tossed a stick, and as you can see in the video in my blog, they jumped when it hit the ground, and only stopped when its smell didn’t register as food.\n\nI have more information about Kachikally in my blog, including a list of reasons you may want to visit and a video of how active the crocodiles are.  The link is in my profile.",

The artifacts etc are quite dated but they are well put together and that adds to the charm of the place, and there were traditional African huts, and a wooden tree hut to explore.  We loved watching the weavers at work, one of whom spoke about being part of a family of weavers and handing down the tradition.  We also sat and listened to a Djembe drummer (they often have a full band apparently), and he was great fun.  A really good introduction to the Gambia.",

          "text": "The Real Gambia\nThat’s what we experienced in our tremendous three week stay in February-March 2009. We were based in Brikama – a medium-sized town about 20 kms inland from the Atlantic and an hour south of the capital Banjul. It’s a fascinating town with a vibrant feel but none of the tourist-area trappings and hassles.\nPeople are very hospitable and very warm to strangers – especially those who are respectful and show a genuine interest in life there. \nOur host, Abdoulie Sarr, is a young entrepreneur whose aims are to create a range of locally-based enterprises to enable visitors to genuinely engage in the life of an area: get to know local people in depth; learn something of a local language; be part of local events; explore the beautiful country areas, learn about a different culture and exchange experiences; and to spend their money in ways that benefit local people rather than international tour operators.\n\nAccommodation and Food (Vegetarians catered for)\nHe provided excellent quality accommodation and three substantial meals a day whist we were in Brikama. Breakfast consisting of a choice of very tasty rice porridge or omelette was delivered to our accommodation every morning and we had the option of having the other meals brought to us or of eating with his family. My travelling companion is vegetarian and we thought this could be a bit of a problem; nothing could be further from the truth. He was served excellent food with his ‘not even fish’ requirements fully respected and catered for.\n\nLocal Life \nEating with the family was much more fun and gave us the opportunity spending time talking with people and playing with the children. In fact, we spent a lot of time just talking and debating a wide range of subjects and laughing a lot– a real exchange!\nBrikama is a fascinating town to explore and Abdoulie’s relaxed but efficient style meant we could go it alone or have him take us to specific locations of interest.\n\nExploring The Gambia\nWe wanted to see the country and Abdoulie organised a three-day trip into the interior travelling by local transport and combining road and river journeys. We enjoyed travelling in the normal vehicles that Gambians used and not in luxury coaches or 4X4s – much more real.\nOur trip took in the Wassu Stone Circles (evidence of ancient civilisation here); the wonderful Janjanbureh Camp with its perfect location on the River Gambia and good quality accommodation and food; the historic towns of Janjanbureh and Kuntaur, the bustling ‘crossroad’ town of Farafenni, the  riverside Tendaba camp and the rural villages along the country’s South road.\n\nBirds and Animals\nWe saw hippos and crocodiles and a huge variety of bird-life along small backwaters that make the Gambia so attractive to bird-watchers\nAbdoulie was an excellent guide with a wealth of local knowledge and contacts which made the trip run smoothly and tailored to what we wanted to see we never felt we were being herded along on a package tour.\n\nMusic\nBack in Brikama we became familiar with the local music scene seeing a number of bands and talking with the musicians. Brikama is major centre for music using the Kora.\n\nA Real Experience\nThe trip was a mind-altering experience into the way of life of a country with wonderful people and beautiful scenery in which the hospitality was outstanding and where we felt welcome and safe at all times. \nAt the end we felt we had had a real experience and had got to know a place and some of its people in depth – a place that is now very special.\n\nContact details\nAbdoulie Sarr provides a range of tailor-made options for accommodation, travel and local experiences across The Gambia and we highly recommend his professional yet personal approach.\nContact: Abdoulie Sarr Tel 00220-7722099/6720999; \nemail Abdouliesarr@hotmail.com",

I approached the fort, not really thinking much of it and thinking I would have a peak then turn around. However was amazingly welcomed by Ebrahim when I arrived. He gave an outstanding tour of the museum and fort. It was amazing to learn about the history and significance of the structure itself as well as the history, language and culture of the Gambian north bank. a spectacular experience - this should be so much more well known and on everyones Gambia bucket list. Easily accessible and hugely enlightening. If you are going, give Ebrahim a ring (you can find his number on the door of the fort if he is around) to make sure he gives you the full experience.",

          "text": "My friends and I booked the Roots day trip to Kunta Kinteh Island with Armstrong Tours, who were based opposite the New Wild Monkey Bar on Serrakunda in Kololi.\n\nThe trip was excellent, but what made it stand out from the trips that we booked through our hotel was Armstrong Tours, their lovely drivers and our guide for the day; Abdoulie.  The trip was cheaper, the group smaller (we didn't lose an hour picking up from various other hotels) and the transport was in a mix of pick-up trucks and jeeps, as well as the ferry to the North and the small boat to the island.  We had a much more authentic journey than that we would have experienced in an air-conditioned coach!  \n\nThe journey from Kololi to Kunta Kinteh is a long one, but well worth it to learn more about the appalling trade in human lives that was carried out.  Abdoulie sat in the back of the jeep with us en-route to the small museum and told us stories about life in Gambia, before passing over to another guide at the museum (I'm sorry, I've forgotten his name) who also took us over to Kunta Kinteh island, who was passionate about passing on the information about the trans-Atlantic slave trade, much of which originated from this point, and ensuring that what happened is never forgotten.  \n\nOn the return journey we stopped at a small village to distribute notebooks and pencils purchased on the way out. It seems like a minor thing but Abdoulie assured us that having grown up in that area he knows how important and appreciated these items are.  They stop at a different village each week so that everyone gets the chance to receive these books and pencils. \n\nBefore boarding the ferry back to the South we returned to the local restaurant where we'd had breakfast and had a traditional Gambian dish of chicken yassa which was absolutely delicious.  \n\nAny trip to the Gambia should include this historical Roots Tour, which most of the tour agencies carry out, but please think about supporting a local business before booking all your tours through your hotel or your travel agency, as not only are all the proceeds then going towards a small local business, but you will also receive a much more authentic, interesting, personal experience.

It was very colourful, and was fascinating to watch.  We walked up through the beach area up towards the road, passing men repairing nets, and children playing, there were a lot of local people there who were mesmerised by two tourists cutting up through the smoke houses with bikes.  We were taken into the smoke houses and the process of smoking was explained and demonstrated - it really is quite primitive but highly effective.  We ate a smoked herring with a local, who I gave 100d to go and get some drinks from the local shop.  He came back with three bottles of Coke, and handed me 70d change...I gave it to him for giving us such a nice tour of the smoke house.  He was very pleased, and walked us up to the road, and waved us goodbye.  We rode back to Kololi using the road.  It was a great visit. To Tanji village, and a real joy to see how the fish are smoked, ready for export.",

These precious, valuable historical items are not well-protected and exposed to air and people touching them,  The items merit a financial investment to upgrade how the items are conserved.\nVery interesting museum with sculpture park in front with 5 sculptures and a mural.\nRestroom is in another building, not wheel chair accessible.",

          "text": "One of my favourite things to do when travelling around the world is going to the musea where countries tell something about their national history. The National Museum of the Gambia is not like the Louvre, Uffizi of the Hermitage, but it shows on its own way a story of national struggle, pride and hope. In a way, walking around here learned me more then a guided tour in the Grand Gallery. Ask your tour guide or hotel if they could drop you off here and spend a moment of your time to look around a d have a chat with the people working here, they love to tell you more about the history of the Gambia. Don't forget to leave a tip, as they will use it for the maintenance of the museum.",

And this is no monumental arch of significance. Bland white concrete that has aged reasonably well.\n\nBuilt post '94 to celebrate the military coup, which has now itself just ended in a mess of lost cash and economic tourist collapse, it has been largely ignored by the locals.  50 delasi get in and a hike of steps to the upper balcony, you do get a good photo view over the low town buildings and over to the dock cranes, over to the other side of the river on a clear day.  A bit of an ad hoc display of local art and history.\n\nSo an if in town option perhaps along with Albert Market and the football stadium.  Don't let your green car driver overcharge you on this one.",

The entrance fee is only 100 DL ( just over £1) and there is an interesting museum about the history of Gambia to go through before one hits the jungle trail. There is a well trodden path, through some huge trees and local monkeys until you hit the pool, where rangers will arrange for visitors to pose with and touch the crocs for some great photo opportunities.  These are fresh water crocs and are fish eaters, and well fed. So humans are quite safe, but even do ard visitors are told to keep well away from the crocs mouths in case you confuse the crocs and they take a bite. If you are lucky on your visit you may get to see Charlie the albino Croc. A good and cheap way to spend a couple of hours.",

Inside the building is sadly neglected and poorly maintained but for the view alone it is certainly worth a visit. The lift may not function very well as we were encouraged to take the stairs and told by the attendant that 'excercise is good in the morning'! The spiral stairs are manageable and should not cause any concern for those of any age or ability. \n\nThe exhibits are interesting and fill you in on the ancient tradition of 'Juju' culture in Gambia. Juju refers to the use of objects and other things to perform a form of witchcraft and a range of such objects are available to look at and learn about. These are a little dusty and poorly maintained but provide a fascinating insight into Juju culture in the Gambia. \n\nThe view from the very top of the structure is best and worth continuing to the top for.",

If you love to barter, don't mind a bit of hassle as you try to find what you are looking for, then you could really enjoy yourself here. Nice little local café at the entrance where for just a little money you can sample the local food, fresh fruit and cold drinks available too at the entrance.  My advice here is to keep your sense of humour, don't get dragged inside the stalls as you WILL not get out without buying something you may not want, but enjoy the fun, the bartering and the genuine openness of the lovely Gambian people. They are trying to earn a living, if you respect them, they will respect you.  Never pay the asking price, it will usually be at least double what they expect you to pay! Fabulous clothes and jewellery and lots of wonderful wooden artefacts to take home as souvenirs. There are even tailors who will whip up an outfit for you in very little time for very fair prices.  Happy shopping and smile!",

Be brave.\n\nThe sights, the sounds, the smells can all be over-whelming and the hangers-on (bumsters in the local parlance) who will magically appear, can be a total pain in the posterior --- but be brave.\n\nGrit your teeth, ignore the bumsters, and go your own way, and you won't be disappointed.........  but time it right. To do the market justice you must allow 2 to 3+ hours and in the heat it can get stifling, so time your visit for either very early in the morning or the late afternoon, and don't forget your water!",

There are some craft stalls which sell local wood carvings and cloths - quality is good and we ended up buying a couple of articles to take home. The place is very crowded and could be a bit intimidating if you were on your own. We went with our taxi man plus a guy from the hotel so didn't experience any hassle from the bumsters. They also showed us around the town & port areas. Would recommend a short visit but take a minder.",

          "text": "BANJUL, GAMBIA 18 MARCH 2014\n\nThis country was made well-known to the world thanks to Alex Haley and his book “Roots” which was made into a television series, and tells the story of a native of The Gambia who is captured as a slave and sent to Virginia in the USA and the trials and tribulations of his life.\n\nGambia which is only 4,360 square miles is the smallest country on the continent, and has a cooperative relationship with its neighbour Senegal, despite having separated from the federation of Senegambia in the early 1990's.  Its first historical accounts come from the Arab traders in the 9th and 10th centuries, it was then taken over by the Portuguese who subsequently sold the trade rights to the British, becoming a colony in 1899, before finally becoming independent in February 1965.\n\nWe didn’t dock until around 11.00 am, so had a leisurely breakfast and a good sail in up The Gambia river.  The shuttle bus service dropped us off in the city centre, at the Albert Market, where we went inside the market itself.   This was almost a repeat of the other markets we had seen, particularly in Takoradi, and had the same produce as in Ghana.  \n\nWe then decided to stroll around the surrounding streets and we very shortly gained a \"minder\", who started to point out various buildings, as I was photographing.  We had been warned by the ship that informal guides known as \"bumsters\" abound.  Initially we ignored him, but when it became too problematic, I told him to go away in Arabic, which not only surprised him, but also did the trick, and he melted away into the crowd.  We then picked up yet another, who purported to be from \"the security\" force (which he wasn’t); he had a badge round his neck to confirm it!  He also proved a pain, and we stopped at some genuine police in the streets to ask the location of the internet café for which we were looking.  Having made certain we were on the right track, we tried to ignore Mr. Minder No. 2 only to find the original guy several paces ahead.  So we then had two “minders” to ignore!\n\nOff the main thoroughfare, the streets were rubbish-strewn and potholed.  Even though we were the only white people, we did not feel threatened because there were plenty of locals around.\n \nWe eventually came to the Internet cafe and ascertained it would be US$1 for an hour.  As the internet speed was really slow, and after checking there were no urgent emails, we left after 20 minutes, thereby fooling our two minders who may have been waiting outside when the hour had elapsed.  On arrival back at the ship there were many stall holders displaying their wares on the quayside and I was tempted and bought a scarf.\n\nAt 5.30pm in the evening the ship recorded the shade temperature as 99.7 F, - 38C!!  However several hours later for deck barbecue, many people repaired to the dining room because of the very cold wind across the open decks, and the residual dining room staff had to be augmented by pool deck staff.",

Then you and the gudie can focus on the trip. No problem with parking etc.\nWith some tour companies you will get this city tour for free if you book two full day tours.\nWe can recomand 4*4 south gambia and the safari in senegal.\nWe used www.bushwhackertours.com with an exellante guide called JJ. We went on four tripps with him. He was very good at adjusting the trip after ours needs.\nWell edjucated in history and local coustums.",

The crocodile park itself is amazing, your literally a few feet from them and if you work with the guides you can actually touch them. Was a shame to see a few tourists not abiding by the guides requests/rules and putting themselves into dangerous situations so please listen to the guides as they are experts with these animals and are extremely aware of keeping them safe too.

          "text": "There's probably a few travel operators providing this tour and there's certainly plenty of locals offering a taxi style trip. But mine was booked through our Gambia experience rep and included the crocodile pond and museum tour. These fish eating crocodiles! once fed are quite content to bask in the shade whilst tourists mingle with them and touch their bodies. It's quite surreal and has a complete disregard for elf n safety or so it appears. The museum is small and informative on the history and culture of the country. Other stops include markets and a tea and coffee stop at a waterside lodge and a traditional wrestling match which was fun. A beach stop to a very pretty beach was some drive  and a decent lunch provided. The last stop to a fishing village was cancelled due to time. Travel was in a open top bedford lorry which was also fun, generally a good experience albeit a little expensive.",

There’s a nice museum at the entrance and a local guide will give you a real flavour of history here and talk about their own tribal histories and customs. \n\nThe walk to the pool itself is interesting - very old tree as well as flora and fauna. \n\nYou suddenly come upon the crocodiles and the first thought is “oh that’s a realistic model” and then you realise the croc next to your foot is alive....\n\nThe crocodile keepers are excellent and touching a live croc was something I won’t forget. Which is good because I’m not doing it again either!\n\nThis was a real highlight. The animals are well cared for and are not drugged or mistreated. Definitely something to do whilst visiting locally. ",

Quite an experience.\n\nWhat I feel should be mentioned is the little tour of the history of The Gambia as well as the people that you walk through efore getting to the crocs. Its well worth it to get someone knowledgable to take you through the little museum they have there.\n\nNo doubt the crocs are the main attraction but why not get a history lesson as well?\n\nI think we paid D100 as an entrance fee. You'd be mad to pass up on this!",

The guides claim they only eat fish and don't touch meat but he wasn't prepared to take the £100 on offer to prove it by swimming across.\nThe opportunity to get up close and actually touch a crocodile. They do seem very tame but no doubt can 'turn' at any time so be careful. \nThere's supposed to be a large albino croc called Charlie present but we didn't get to see him as he only appears at feeding time they say.\nLots of little crocs around out of the pool just basking in the sun. Don't walk off the beaten track though as you could easily stumble upon a nest of eggs with the mother watching over them. There's also a few snakes around so perhaps put on some long trousers for protection.\nSmall entry fee of 100 Gambian Dalasi (around £1.50)\nNice little museum at the entrance charting some of the history of the area and the influence of the British under colonial rule.",

I wouldn’t wanna be there when there’s a group of 20-30 tourist that just got there.\n\nThat said, it’s good fun and a good thrill. Even though they’re well fed with fish, it’s still an exciting event to be able to touch them and feel the skin of these prehistoric survivors.\n\nEntrance fee is about 100 dalasi.\n\nThis includes the museum with some of the festive and traditional clothing, music instruments and the juju (voodoo) department.",

          "text": "The experience as a whole is definitely one that everyone should take time to partake in, but be warned that an entire day should be set aside for this adventure. Depending on where you start out, this trip can be very time-consuming, especially if you're on the southern bank and have to use the ferry to cross from Banjul to Barra. The ferry is inconsistent and isn't in the best of shape. \nRegardless the island itself is slowly deteriorating and the locals try their best to make it an enjoyable experience. The island itself can be seen in roughly ten minutes but I've found that the guide often makes the experience better depending on how much they actually know about the island's history. This is typically followed by a tour of a slave trade museum which is housed in an old British warehouse. The museum is informative but could use some better upkeep. Entry to it is free, but if you desire to take photos then you'll have to pay 100 Gambian Dalasi. \n\nOverall I think it's a great experience and adventure to have, but I think it's a one-and-done kind of trip.",

There are also 1 or 2 up at the top where the guides allow you to go to close to them and take pictures as well as touch them. Crocs are fed a lot of food on the morning so they are not interested in attacking (or even moving), hence the guides assuring you of your safety (They aren't drugged despite the bad reviews)\n\nDefinitely worth a visit with a tourist taxi rather than a big group, there were less than 10 people there when we visited, well worth spending an hour or so there",

          "text": "Myself and my partner enjoy nature reserves and also sighting animals and so we believed that this would be the perfect place to visit.\nWe got a taxi there and the taxi driver would wait 2 hours. This was fine. It all went wrong after this! \nThe park is 35D each which is fine but then they are white tourists coming and then the coming starts! Suddenly the price was 370D and forced into having a guide and paying for the taxi driver who wasn’t even joining us! Apparently it is too “dangerous” to go without a guide. Then after this rip off we had to hire binoculars for all the birds and wildlife we will be seeing. Another 100D! So far it has cost quite a lot more than expected. First impressions seem run down so I now wasn’t expecting much and was annoyed at being ripped off. What followed was a walk with a very sweaty guide with foul body odour who spoke not very good English. What I could make out was mostly about palm trees and the English man who originally founded the park just over 40 years ago. We were taken to the crocodile pool. No crocs to be seen. Disappointing. Two birds in the distance - use the expensive binoculars. Surprise, surprise they don’t work! We were then ushered into a dreadful “gift shop” selling over priced junk and almost forced to buy something. With a very poor booklet at 450D we just gave a 200D donation to get out of the room! \nAfter this it was a boiling hot walk through a sandy path with more nonsensical waffling from the smelly guide. We saw some monkeys in trees but this was it. The walk led (after what seemed like ages) to an abysmal excuse for a zoo. Hyenas in cages with vultures and baboons in another cage. Such cruel conditions. Some monkeys roamed around wanting to be fed which resulted in another attempt to take money from us. We refused. A man was trying to sell wooden ornaments. I didn’t even bother looking at them. Was so disappointed with this place. Luckily the guide didn’t demand a tip at the end otherwise the tip would have been - this place needs shutting down. ",

The museum is very informative and worth checking out and that may be why so many people rate this experience high, but the crocodile portion is disturbing.  The crocs are so lethargic they seem to almost not be alive.  I can't imagine how they are so docile... they say it is because they are well fed, but I would think they would have to be way overfed or medicated to lay around as they do. As soon as we entered the \"pool\" area and saw the crocodiles like that we walked right through and then out of the park.  I understand that animal attractions can harbor a lot of feelings and I entered into this with an open mind but I can't recommend.",

It's all written down in a book so you feel as though it will be used appropriately. The museum is fascinating and worth spending time in each room, although is all written in English so you may want a translation tool if you are not able to read in English. It is worth not rushing to the crocodiles if you love nature and spend some time the other side of the pool as we saw numerous birds including two types of kingfisher. There are also monkeys and rather randomly goats. If you are in the area you should make the visit and from further afield it would be worth negotiating a price with a local taxi driver. We didn't have a guide nor did we feel that we needed one.",

We had our own birdguide, Mas Sangeng, arranged by Farakunku Lodges where we were based, however there are guides available to hire at the reserve. Our guide was excellent and we would not have seen half the birds and wildlife without him. The area around the crocodile pool was a bit noisey, some boats were being taken on to the pond and this disturbed any birds there. Green Vervet Monkeys played around the benches and seemed used to visitors. It was further along the pathways we started to encounter the more interesting birds,  Green and Violet Turaco, Western Bluebill and African Paradise Flycatcher to name just a few.  With patience and a good guide the possibilities are endless.  We had no interest in visiting the \"zoo\" preferring to spend our time looking for birds and we were not disappointed.",

          "text": "Situated on the side of the airport road to Serekunda and the beach resorts, the park is easily reached by taxi from most hotels, and is an ideal ‘on your own’ half day out when you have exhausted your tour operators organised trip portfolio.\n\nThe self-appointed title ‘Nature Reserve’ does however raise the expectations of the first time visitor, which are unlikely to be met, hence the string of negative reviews.\nOn arrival, first stop is the ticket hut, where you are relieved of a modest 35 Dalasi each . . . so far so good. You are then directed to an open hut where several ‘guides’ are waiting. We told them we had been before and were happy to go unaccompanied; the reply is ‘snakes sir; lots of snakes . . . if you don’t know where to look, very dangerous’.\nThe guides were all wearing combat trousers tucked into high laced army boots while I was wearing M&S linen shorts with a pair of Reeboks; I figured they may well have a point.\nIn an act of extortion that The Peaky Blinders would be proud of, we were instantly relieved of a further 300D, but they had not finished yet . . . ‘you will need binoculars’ they tell us, and whoosh, another 100 changes hands.\nWhat follows is in essence a very nice walk following a well worn path through shady and peaceful woodland, a few birds along the way but nothing you won’t see around your hotel, an army of ants crossing the path, some epic spider’s webs, but not much else.\nNext stop is the natural lake containing several hard to spot crocs; you are led up wooden steps to an observation platform which doubles up as a gift shop; another hard sell along the lines of ‘the park runs on donations and what the tourists spend’;  we were in need of a few trinkets for nieces back home, but sadly the variety of gifts was on par with the variety of wildlife, and we escaped wallet intact and empty handed.\nAnother meandering walk with more of the same; 20 years ago, the path was lined with monkeys, eager to be fed with the bananas that were sold at the entrance; no bananas this time, and no monkeys; there is now a snack stall at the enclosures, and the monkeys learned very quickly that simply hanging around here will keep them well fed with the minimum effort.\nThey have however become very spiteful and greedy, and will quickly snatch the newly purchased bag of monkey nuts from your hand. The photo opportunities are there, if not a little predictable and staged, and short of a few hyenas in a large pen not much else here to detain you.\nExit is via another walk along another path, and is a different place to your drop-off, but your taxi driver will know this and be waiting for you. A gift shop is at the exit, giving another couple of desperate women one last opportunity to mug you before you disappear forever. The guide then hints heavily that he is not paid and relies on tips; you say I have already paid 300, he says yes but I don’t get that, we part with one final 200 for the guide and find our taxi.\nWe asked our driver to stop off at Lamin Lodge on the way back for a lunch break; we then detoured back via the pharmacy for a few bits, then the mini market for a few more; all in all, a good half day away from resort, but a nice shady walk only; no more, no less.\nHugely overpriced for what it is; (we spent 670D plus cokes and monkey nuts); better opportunities locally to resort for both monkeys and crocs, and at a fraction of the price.\nDon’t expect too much; don’t bother with binoculars, and ditch the guide if you can.",

I didn't know hyenas could be friendly!!\n\nThen on leaving the park there is a massive hippos head on display, the guide said they killed the hippo as he was eating the locals rice fields, told him it's cruel and sick for keeping the head on display, he didn't agree....\n \nThe park has potential to be better and house more animals as it did a few years back but they need to make sure animals are taken care of and I don't think tourists will appreciate seeing a rotting hippo head!!\n\nApart from that, nice few hours out and a lot of walking.",

The cages are too small and they do not seem to have a nice and happy life. I don't think that such intelligent creatures should be held in a prison and it made me sad to see that.\n\nBut if you skip the zoo part you might enjoy it, because it's a really nice place for a walk. They don't want to let you go inside without a local guide, but don't mind them, you won't get lost! If you get a guide, you need to pay for the entrance fee and also some tip to the guide - not worth it. You'll see the monkeys and lots of birds anyway :)",

It would have been much nicer to simply take our time and wonder through the reserve.\n\nIt was generally a pretty reserve and we did see some green vervet monkeys who were quite happy to have their photo taken but if this is what you are looking for then Bijilo park is a much better nature park with more monkeys and just as nice/nicer scenery.\n\nThere were Baboons and Hyenas in cages in one section but I tend not to like seeing animals unnecessarily in cages so did not find this an enjoyable part of the park. They had also had a hippo there which had died recently and they kept its head on display (not pleasant to look at!)   \n\nWe had a nice day but I didn't think this park and any advantages over Bijilo ",

You get to walk a path with your guide around the place when suddenly you notice there is no fence between you and those crocodiles about 4 feet away.  Luckily, only a few are moving and you are really glad they were fed earlier in the day.  I would question your fitness as a parent if you brought your kiddos on your visit.  Just remember if you want to touch one (and people do) touch the crocodile as far away from its mouth as possible.  If you love Komodo Island and its free roaming dragons you will like this place.",

We were the only people there. There was a 200 delacies entrance fee. Before going to see the crocodiles there is a small museum we walked around which consisted of 3 rooms with information  about the area , pictures and a few historical artefacts. The whole way round we were accompanied by a cat. He literally walked everywhere with us until we got to the exit of the rooms. Instinctively the cat stopped at the door and left us to continue out towards the crocodiles. She obviously knew not to go out there around the crocodiles, we stopped at a very ver old massive cotton tree on the way towards the crocodiles. The young man who cared for the crocodiles were so informative and put us at ease as when we got out towards the crocodiles. On this occasion, there were plenty of them out on the land. We counted at least 12 crocodiles amongst leaves and against the trees. This was a scarily wonderful experience to be this close to the crocodiles, we even saw the albino crocodile which was so big. The young man showed us the crocodile eggs and told us about the crocodiles. We made a small donation towards feeding the crocodiles as they must go through a large amount of fish to keep them going. This was a fantastic experience. Definitely not for the faint hearted.",

          "text": "Located about 30 minutes from Banjul, in the Bakau district, is the Kachikally Sacred Crocodile Pool believed by the locals for its healing powers and as a place of last resort for infertile women who wish to conceive.  the women seeking the special blessing are washed by trained women and are told not to shake hands with anyone in Bakau. Others with ailments come to the pool to seek luck and make offers to the crocs in return.  The walk to the pool is reached from the mail road by a 600-meter dirt pathway that is lined by poverty-stricken housing and dozens of young children approaching you asking for money or school supplies.\n\nThe  entrance wall is colorfully painted with wildlife scenes. Once inside, you walk on a path towards the pool where it is said that there are over 80 crocodiles in and around the pool  but we only saw four small crocks. The well-fed crocs are docile.  Visitors are allowed to touch or stroke the tail--not the head.  \n\nExpect to spend about 30 minutes in the facility.  Other than the few crocs there is not much to see.  Worth a visit if you are in the area but otherwise not much to see although it is described as a popular tourist site.  At the end of the tour the owner requests \"donations\" to feed the crocs.",

The park itself is off the main highway and at the bottom of a very local impoverished area.\nEntrance fee is 100 dalasi per adult (guides/ drivers free). You do not need a guide for this attraction. \nThere’s a very small museum beside the park, a very short walk to the crocodile pool and that is all there is. \nYou can “stroke” the albino crocodile, see others lying around in the sun and there’s opportunity  to make a donation towards the cost of feeding them. Allow 30-45 mins max for this attraction. \n\nTruthfully the poverty on the streets surrounding the park was more of an experience and impacting than seeing the crocodiles but that’s the reality of living in The Gambia….for some life is very hard.",

They had hyenas there, vultures and a little place to get a bite to eat. Easily spend a couple of hours there. \nYou can take a guide or go in on your own,  easy to find your way around doing it alone. \nTruly loved it! ",

Here we were met by the middle aged caretaker who gave us a 15 minute tour that included touching the back of a well fed male albino crocodile who was resting peacefully among 15 more of normal color. He showed a video of their morning feeding, tossing plump fish from a full wheelbarrow as the crocs emerged from the pool in increasing numbers. He then guided us along the pool trail pointing out the unapproachable aggressive females and several semi submerged crocs among the 80 that live around this pool. \nFurther along, we stopped to admire an old Kapok with huge buttress roots when a monkey appeared that was nursing babies. Finally we were shown a rice field(matured at the end of the wet season) soon to be harvested and prepared for planting dry season vegetables. \nBefore departing, we signed a book to make a small contribution to feeding the crocs.  \nDelightful ½ hour visit.",

          "text": "The Abuko Nature Reserve is a large forest protected by the Government of The Gambia. It was once developed and maintained by the University of Warwick in the UK as a Darwin Field Station for biodiversity study, a project that ended in 2005. Since then, the developed portions of the Reserve have been abandoned and taken over by \"bumsters\" who know nothing about nature or biodiversity, but have figured out a number of scams to take your money. \n\nFor example, the true entry fee for the park is 15 Dalasis as shown on the official receipt you are given...upon payment of 400 Dalasis!. In my case, I did not notice the receipt until I had paid the 400 Dalasis...too late sucker! Mysteriously, I was given a sticker to enter a privately owned exotic animal zoo on the highway outside of the park as a consolation. These \"proprietors\" apparently figured out an arrangement with the owners of the zoo to sell entry to that separate enterprise, off-site, under the guise that it was a mandatory fee to enter the Reserve. I was then asked for another 100 Dalasis to rent a pair of binoculars with no strap. I later found that the 10 X 50 glasses had been dropped and damaged so that the mirror prisms inside had been knocked out of alignment rendering them useless. Inasmuch as they were extremely heavy and without a strap, I simply pitched them into my sack and carried on with my own self-guided walk through the pathways of the Reserve. \n\nI respectfully declined the extremely high pressure mandatory but voluntary but mandatory requirement to hire a guide for another 300 Dalasis because I did not want to be accompanied by an unofficial \"guide\" who knew nothing about the faunna, flora and wildlife except what one could see anyway with the naked eye. The last thing I wanted was someone talking to me incessantly for the duration of my experience which did turn out to be a very beautiful 2-hour stroll through a luxurant forest full of wildlife. \n\nAbout halfway into the Park, I came across the remains of the Darwin Biodiversity Field Station which is adorned with old rotting posters and two bumsters dressed in disco garb and sunglasses who, not surprisingly, were requesting more \"donations.\" They presented a \"guestbook\" that was undated, but appeared to be signed by people who were donating up to 500 Dalasis for a project that unbeknownst to them was terminated in 2005. The donation box was not only unlocked, but it had disappeared with the slot simply allowing the money to fall on the floor. When I asked who would get the money, the \"boys,\" probably in their late 20s,  stated that the money would go to \"the man.\" The station had some displays of bones that the boys had collected in the forest, lying on a table, and the remnants of old biodiversity exhibits. This field station offered no information about what was going on in the park. \n\nNotably, no one in the park, at the entrance or at this field station, could sell me a simple map of the park. For all the come-ons for money, one would have thought the easiest sell would have been a map of the park itself so that patrons like myself could find their way around the winding pathways, as obvious as they are. But then, enabled with a map, who would need a guide? This was a very simple thing to prepare and distribute for which I would have paid gladly. The absence of maps ws designed to compel the purchase of a guide. Who wants foreign visitors to have a pleasant walk through the park on their own? Certainly the proprietors do not. \n\nNevertheless, continuing on from the field station, I had an extremely pleasant experience noting crocodiles, many more exotic birds than I had anticipated, and plenty of monkeys. It truly is a beautiful experience if you would like to take a walk for a couple of hours on your own. At all costs, however, I would avoid the sucker plays of everyone who is offering you something for money, especially their delightful company and incessant banter while you are trying to listen to the nature and take it all in. \n\nNear end of the pathway on the interior of the park there is what appears to be a legitimate zoo which contains hyenas, baboons and wild monkeys. These animals are kept in these cages on the explanation that they were once domesticated and the proprietors are attempting to allow them to re-adapt to their natural environment. They would be released in six months. I cannot imagine who would have domesticated the hyenas that I saw in those cages. They were huge! Domesticated baboons? Finally, the exit trail leads you onto, of all place,  the main highway far from your starting point. There you will find the UK owned zoo that contains some exotic animals outside of their natural habitat such as lions and cheetahs. Although I had unwittingly been forced to pay for entry into the Reserve, I passed on the idea, walked down the driveway onto the main highway, and then walked about three quarters of a kilometer down the highway to reunite with my vehicle at the entry of the park. It seemed an odd configuration to enter at one end, and then be dumped onto a main highway only to walk along noisy and fierce traffic to get back to your starting point. \n\nIn the end, I did enjoy the walk and the exposure to nature that I found there. I'm afraid, however, that the fact that it has been spoiled by fraudulent tricks and and parasitic squatters who have taken over a once well-maintained biodiversity project assured me that I would not return to this place. Left alone, it is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it is been spoiled by the unnatural. There are many other better maintained or unmaintained nature reserves in The Gambia that are well worth my time and money. Be forewarned!",

There is a rather sad zoo towards the rear of the park where there are one or two sorry looking hyenas and baboons but I understand that the plan is to improve this facility in conjunction with the near-by Eagle Heights Park which is also worth a visit.",

He was very patient with us and wished to ensure we saw as much as possible. Beware of fake guides - to ensure a good guide, we recommend you ask for Ansu at the Bird Watchers Association located next to the Bridge in Kotu.  ",

He took us on a long tour and allowed us to borrow his binoculars to view the crocodiles and kingfishers around the water.  We also saw vultures, ospreys, termite mounds, bushbuck antelopes and inside the Eagle Heights Centre (which is within the Abuko Nature Reserve) we saw baby vultures, tortoises, birds of prey, a lion cub called Babar and even a cheetah couple!  Very educational and the conservation work they are doing here is excellent.  The animals are very well looked after and if any are in cages this is only ever for breeding or rehabilitation purposes.",

We have been a few times in the past, many years ago & had a good time, although I was never too keen on the condition the animals were kept in. We were taking friends out for a day & thought it would be nice to visit. \n\nOn arrival our driver enquired about the price & said we just wanted to drive straight into the centre. He was told its 400 d each!!!! And we had to take a guide for the walk through the forest. I understand this is the guides only mean of income but we didn't want to do the walk, we've never had this problem before. We explained we only wanted to see the centre but was told we had to do all if it so we got back in the car. The man came over & said ok what will you pay for what you want to do. I said it's too late, as he was being greedy we would just go to lamin lodge for a drink. Bad luck, you lost out. \n\nSome other friends of ours did visit, on my recommendation (from past experiences) they said it was extremely overpriced, the animals were in appalling conditions & overall it was rubbish. Sorry guys, had I known how badly it had gone down hill & how expensive it was I would have told them not to bother. \n\nStick to the crocodile pond at 50d each.",

A guide named Billy had excellent knowledge, I felt it a real Shame that these guides are not employed by the park which is government owned & it's quite expensive compared to other tourist attractions in Gambia, so it was shocking to me that Billy only got paid the tips! There was a very wounded hyena which was a little concerning, apparently he had fought with the others. All other animals seemed happy & healthy. Eagle heights is very new & therefore they don't have many animals to see but the staff are very knowledgeable.",

A monkey in a cage that was paralysed from the waist down, had to drag himself to the food, questioned the keepers who lied and said it only arrived the previous day, which later was found not to be true it had been like it for over a month, I offered to pay for the vet to come out and humanly put it to sleep!!!!!!!.

Set among almost 500 acres you will be entranced by the flora and fauna around you. \n\nCurrently at the Centre are our 2 Cheetah with which we are hoping to begin a successful breeding project. A selection of Birds of Prey including a Crowned Eagle, Lanner Falcon, Tawny Eagle and Bateleur Eagle! \n\nThe current orphanage inside Abuko will be collaborating with us enabling us to move the Hyena from their current enclosure to a new and improved version. This also applies to the Baboons and any other animals that arrive at the orphanage from now on. \n\nDaily Talks will take place along with a flying demonstration. You will also be invited to take a pit stop at our Bar for an all important refreshment!\n\nFollowing the opening of the centre we will then begin our second project, Reintroduction! We will be reintroducing many once indigenous species back into the Abuko Buffer Zone. These are species that once lived there naturally but were unfortunately wiped out by humans etc.",

There are also a pair of resident nile crocodiles that inhabit the lake.. You can see many of the kingfisher species here aswell as palm nut vulture, violet turaco, hammerkop and a few hornbill species! Small fee to get in but if you have a good guide the cost of your guide normally means they pay for you! At the end of the trail at Abuko there is a woodland bar where you can get close to the vervet monkeys but don't get too close as a scratch or bite could lead to worse! By the bar is an animal orphanage of injured wild animals in recovery including baboons, Patas monkey and spotted hyena",

They have Hyenas who are to fat to even chase the vultures away from pinching their food, never seen such fat animals. Also caged  baboons. The keeper told me most of these animals have been rescued from bad homes. I was concerned about a very skinny Baboon but I was told he was taken from a soldier who was not looking after him. They certainly do their best to look after the animals. Refreshments in the centre of the park with some seats in the shade, that was nice. I enjoyed the day, would recommend a visit",

In the same cage last year was a giant tortoise and a pelcan,no sign of those and seeing the conditions they living in I fear the worse .

And we really did not see anything, not even birds. We walked an hour in the \"jungle\". There was a \"crocodile pool\" where was supposed to be 50 or something crocodiles, didnt see any, and nobody else has seen.\n\nWelt kind of like cheated, had to pay for the quide too.

          "text": "Second visit to this lovely natural place, great for birds and walking as mentioned previously - however the small animal orphanage as it is called within this place needs financial help from what I can see.  There are some Hyena's in a large cage however hidden next to the pelican is another cage with some very poorly looking Hyenas with sores etc, I'm not judging but from what I understand, this place needs some help to make sure the animals are cared for more, ie more food, medical help for animals and better quality of surroundings that they live in day after day.  The baboons could do with ropes and tyres hanging and things to amuse them and play with for example.  As its mainly tourists that visit this place, they could increase the entrance fee which could help. I have may ideas as to how this could be improved and would love to be able to help in someway.  That said, the wild monkeys are used to people and they will come and see you especially if you buy monkey nuts and will gently take them out of you hand which is a fantastic experience and one of the main reasons i viisit the place.",

I've had \"guides\" describe birds as little brown jobs and others that not only correctly identify but give you Latin names as well now that's just showing off!  Ask for a try before you buy  agree a price and get them to walk with you for 10 mins  and let them show you the birds you'll soon know what you've got  You can go it alone as it is difficult to get lost just follow the path but the good guide will show you so much more than you'll see going it alone and are well worth the 400D fee for their services",

If you are not don't think they are freebies and say no.\nAfter paying the fee and entering the park another man comes up with a donation form for maintenance on the park. They should include that in the ticket price and don't hassle on every opportunity.\n\nWe spotted some beautiful trees and we came across some monkeys. (we dont have the expert eye for birds so we didnt notice them) Also some termite hills.\nSomewhere halfway there were some animals caged up. Baboons, 2 pelicans, a turtle and some hyena's.\nThe smaller monkeys run around and you can buy a bag of peanuts there to feed them. (about 25D for a bag) The bigger ones come pick them out of your hand and they can be quite greedy so you have to throw some around for the smaller ones to also enjoy some.\n\nMore walking ahead you come through a souvenir area.\n\nThis trip is for you if you like to walk a small hour and like to see some nature and animals.\n\nAfterwards we also stopped at the nearby goat and sheep market.",

          "text": "I lived in The Gambia in the 1970s, and spent every Sunday morning walking around the nature reserve, mainly birdwatching.  It is such a pleasure to return so many years later and find it almost unchanged, though sadly they need more funding to keep things going.  The highlight is watching the birds from the upstairs viewing area in the large building next to the lake, which also has crocodiles.  Take your binoculars and you will see so many different species!  Then the walk through the forest is fascinating, so many different trees, and with luck you will see plenty of monkeys, both the Callithrix and the Red Colobus monkeys.  They are easy to spot as they scamper through the trees, and trees with have fruit are often absolutely full of monkeys!  Unfortunately I didnt spot a monitor lizard on this visit, though there are many large lizards in the park, and snakes too, though the reptiles are much more active during the rainy season.  Halfway round the walk you reach the animal orphanage, which is a very sad sight with monkeys and baboons in enclosures, when they should be roaming wild.  Its all very dilapidated and makes you feel sorry for the animals.  At the end of the walk round there is a craft market, not very good I'm afraid, so it's better to hurry straight through!",

I think these people have the wrong expectations.\n\nThe museum and the park itself is small but it tells you a lots of stories about The Gambia; history, politics, people, the different tribes and their customs (clothes, instruments). I got a lot of insights during this visit, and I am thrilled to understand some of the differences and similarities between the different tribes.\n\nWalking towards the crocodile pool we passed a -huge- tree with a hollow body that could encircle ten of us (photo session time), a lots of other trees and lianes (shadow!), and fields were the women work with the family crops (photo session time).\n\nThe crocodile pool was at first glance not that much to talk about, but suddenly they were crawling up to meet us and there were crocodiles everywhere. Cool and a bit scary :)\n\nIf you want to be close to a crocodile, go here. If you dont, stay home.\nAnd, dont be stupid, they are still crocodiles even when they are recently fed ;)",

          "text": "Abuko is a wonderfully intact piece of tropical forest, amongst the otherwise heavily populated Serrekunda area. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this a zoo, it's not! There is a small animal orphanage at one end of the reserve but its a desperately sad place and not a reason to visit.\n\nI enjoyed wandering the narrow paths seeing birds, lizards and monkeys (you will see them if you walk slowly and quietly). The Darwin field centre is an excellent vantage point to see lots of wading birds and birds of prey as well as Nile Crocodiles.\n\nThe guides are knowledgeable and well worth taking along on an initial visit. I agree with the previous reviewer who advised taking water with you, it's quite a long way to do the full reserve circuit and the heat is sapping. The reserve doesn't get much funding so facilities are basic, but I loved it for being so quiet without lots of other people around.\n\nI would recommend Abuko more to the serious nature lover who will get more from it than someone who expects to be entertained and see an animal every 2 minutes. For me, taking time was rewarded by getting to see amazing species like the Giant Kingfisher close up. I enjoyed it so much I actually went twice during my week in The Gambia.",

They climb up you, sit on your shoulders etc as you feed them monkey nuts. So many monkeys!  Book the trip with the RSPB men on Bakau beach (under white umbrella by Calypso Restaurant) if you want to enjoy spotting the birds as well as well as knowledge of the local monkeys. If not then go with the tour guides opposite the Ocean Bay Hotel. They charged us 20 quid which included the taxi & full mornings entertainment plus relaxing time sat under the African sun shades on the beautiful beach next to the park.",

However, on our way back out there were huge groups arriving. I would definately recommend going independantly with your own guide rather then with a tour company in a large group. We saw a huge variety of birds and ther were certainly some very enthusiastic bird watchers there with all the high tech binoculars, telescopes, cameras etc. We also saw a couple of crocodiles and lots of monkeys. Halfway round there is an animal sanctuary where they house animals that have been removed from locals who have bought them to entertain tourists for a charge. There was a very friendly monkey that sat on my knee and played with my hair. You can buy peanuts to feed to the monkeys. We absolutely loved our time here and spent a good 3 hours wandering around spotting monkeys and birds. From what I remember it cost approx 50d (£1) each to get in.",

It is better to come here early in the morning, not around 11am like we did since most of the animals are sheltering from the heat and crocodiles are swimming closer to the bottom of the pond.\n\nThe few monkeys we saw were not scared of humans, this is because they are used to humans feeding them. People saying it was great to feed wild monkeys probably have not been to a safari or national park before. Infact you are encouraged to buy peanuts for the monekys. And the zoo in the middle is apparently kept there so tourists can atleast see something in the reserve if nothing else. It is expensive to run these reserves and you can see that in the health of the hyenas and monkeys. The place was grand back in the day with lion(s) and other animals, when the founder Mr.Brewster was alive but now has deteriorated a little. The president's zoo is better funded and has more animals.\n\nSaying that, we had a lovely walk around the area and saw some birds. Since we were not bird watchers or bird lovers, we just enjoyed the different varieties without knowing what they were :-)",

I was told that the baboons are orphaned (though it was a whole family), and also some of the other animals, but that the hyenas are just an exhibit. There also used to be a lion there but it escaped. Apparently they have links with the local zoo, and some of the animals live in captivity always. There is no need for this - visitors come to see wildlife in its natural state, not kept in a prison. The hyenas were pacing up and down i.e. exhibiting stereotypical behaviour, which was not good to see at all.\n\nAlso although there are notices up saying not to feed the wildlife however friendly it is, people (and one of the guides!) were openly feeding the monkeys peanuts, thus habituating the monkeys to humans, and causing them to lose their natural skills. Abuko should actively be fining people for doing this and the guides should be sufficiently educated so as not to do this. \n\nFor this reason I have given this reserve a 3-star rating, otherwise it would be a 4 or 5.",

Keep the plastic bag out of slight or they will grab at it! \n\nIt was fantastic to feed wild monekys. This made the trip well worth it. \n\nIf you drove to the park, like I did, as a bit of advice, when you get to the cafe, go visit the hyenas and stuff, but don't go through the past with the exit sign over it. Go back the way you came, otherwise you end up a 15 minute walk down a dusty busy road from where you first started!!\n",

Just remember you are seeing the reality which is definately in technicolour in this place - Fab! ",

Then you go to the pool and there are over 100 crocs just basking in the sun. You can stroke them. Some people just lark about which is really pathetic as these are wild animals. Well fed on fish but still not to be messed with. Some fools think they are Crocodile Dundee and naturally the guides tell those people off. The crocs seemed happy enough to me.

It was a 100 dalasi fee for entry for adults while the kids went in free. We started off with the tour of the mini museum then proceeded to the pool where the crocodiles are. You are allowed to touch the crocodiles and definitely pictures are allowed this is with the assistance of a tour guide. You can make voluntary donations that goes towards the feeding of the crocodiles, they are fed only fish. I will say it was yet again a beautiful experience. ",

We had mixed feelings, we had the feeling that the animals were sedated and moreover got a 'Lacoste' touch - say, treating wild and normally voracious animals as pets. \nOptional donations are asked for and I wish to think that at a major part is for croc food. The surroundings give a chance to see how the locals live their lifes. Tip: take a taxi driver 'green' to organise the tour for you.",

Well organised and worth the money. He is always down on the beach.",

You can get up close to the crocodiles. You are allowed to touch the crocodile. Not sure if that is normal. The keeper said they feed them the night before so they are not hungry when tourist are around. \n\nThe keeper will ask you to donate money to feed the crocodile.

Just don't expect a major tourist attraction - and we didn't find any toilets!\nQuite simply, this is a rather muddy pool surrounded by trees and occupied by an assortment of tame crocodiles that do very little. It is apparently used for fertility rituals and is owned by one of the wealthiest families in Gambia\nYes, you can touch the crocodiles if you feel brave. You will be surrounded by other visitors most of the time and the 'keepers' will try (insistently) to sell you handmade crocodile teeth necklaces and other overpriced craft items.\nI was slightly perturbed by the keeper's insistence that we should give him a 'donation' to pay for the crocodile's fish, especially as we had just paid to get in. Was this official or just another Bumster trick? I suspect the latter!\nThe best bit for me was the small museum at the venue's entrance. There are some interesting examples of local drums and musical instruments with some ceremonial costumes. I was particularly fascinated by the display of old photographs. For me, this was worth the entrance fee on its own.\nIn short, Katchikally is a tourist trap, but a relatively gentle one. The crocodile custodians are generally pleasant and you will almost certainly enjoy your visit.",

When you walk along you will find the crocodiles that have been fed already so you are able to touch them.

          "text": "This was my second time to Gambia and I could not miss to visit this place one more time.  Last time it was summer so the pool was not full of water but this time it was raining and the experience was simply amazing.  The pool was full of water so could not see the Crocs lying on the side.\nYou enter the park by paying a nominal fee and if lucky find crocodiles walking along with you on the side or may be just lying next to the walking path.  They are harmless until she is a female.  Female is more into defense to protect her eggs.  You reach near the pool and find so many of them just lying over there, may be waiting for you to sit besides them and have your pictures taken.  Believe me, it is an amazing experience irrespective you like animals or not.  These Crocs are never fed meat and they eat almost 3,000 Kg of fish daily (that's what rangers told, not sure how much true it is).  Please make sure that the rangers are around and guide you which Croc to be with while taking the pictures.  Stay away from the female Crocs.  If the water level is a bit low in the pool then you can go close by and see many Crocs walking towards you from the water or the side.  There is nothing to worry about but you must need to take precautions while with animals.  There is a small shop that sells crocodile tooth and they are not expensive, may be around 150 - 200 dalasis.  They also ask for the donation and have maintained a register of donors.\nThey have a nicely maintained museum in the front that depicts many ancient and authentic articles including weapons, cooking vessels, musical instruments etc.  There is also a history of Gambia associated with it if you are interested into it.\nIt is a belief of the locals that a lady who is not able to conceive a baby can visit this place and take a dip in the pool to be an expectant mom in the future.",

Children are happy if you give them something to eat or something small like a ball. \nBakau pool is completely filled with crocs. You have to see it to believe it. You can touch them ( I' m not a fan). I' ve filmed it for my pupils, they found me an awesome teacher :-) ",

We went around the smoke huts where the process was explained to us, we met the ladies who were gutting/descaling the fish and got to look at where they lived and worked in some detail. The smell was awful but made the visit. We then walked down onto the beach where the fishing boats where either pulling in or were already there and the queues of people waiting for the fish to be offloaded, there were families of all ages moving around.\n\nA walk the the market area was also an eye opener, no ice for keeping the fish cold, just buy it a get it home seems to be the motto.\n\nThe Gambians are a generally happy people and we were made to feel welcome, the women and some men are not keen on having their pictures taken so just be aware of that, ask first if unsure.\n\nAll in all well worth a visit, I would have liked to have spent more time there or gone back but time didn't allow that.",

Personally I found that starting at a third of the initial price meant you ended up somewhere just over half the initial price suggested!

The wooden carvings are fantastic and if you want to make a little change to something, they are very accommodating.

It can be hard to choose who to buy from as most of the 'shops' sell similar goods.  Try to haggle, I know it can be hard but it is actually good fun when you get into it for something that you really want to take home.  I'm never cut throat though.

          "text": "This market is both organized and chaotic. I'm sure that doesn't make too much sense but that's how I can describe it. It's like your typical market- fruits, vegetables, general goods, clothing- you name it. It's broken up in sections so all like items are within the same area. It's not for the faint of heart so you've never experienced outdoor markets from anywhere in the developing world, I suggest a guide or proceed with caution. It's safe, no one will bother you. It can be overwhelming and you may get some talkative vendors here and there. I felt very comfortable walking around with someone who was familiar with the do's and don'ts of the market, so I was very happy to have a guide. I learned a lot about the market through him as well. He even treated me to fruits, and showed me some less traveled areas in the market that I surely would not have been able to easily do had I gone solo. If you're interested, his name is Kebba and he can be contacted via WhatsApp at +220 342 1046. I even contacted him on such short notice and he was able to arrange a tour for me within just a couple of hours! He's extremely professional, reasonably priced, excellent English speaking skills, and former Gambian military, so you're in very trusted hands.",

We could not resist fresh fruits, a souvenir shirt of The Gambia, and some good réplica of husos made into decor.  We spent time learning about various qualities, origins, and weaving componentes of colorgul fabrics.  \nVendors were generally pleasant with only a few marketing their goods with extra enthusiam. \nThe market can be fun and can also have challenges.  Everyone speaks English. \nDelightful market",

You cannot take photos of locals unless you buy from them. It is not safe to go alone as you get too much hassle and pick picketers . Our taxi driver accompanied us so no hassle at all. Didn’t buy  much but  nice to see locals selling their food. You can also see junta minutes island from there.",

You will definitely have to haggle for prices, once they know you're a tourist they always add on 5 times the price so I'd advice if the craft man says 3000 dalasi price it down all the way to 500 till you get to a reasonable price. It is definitely a good place to buy art work but be ready to haggle! ",

If you are confident enough it is also worth looking around here and the fishermen are most obliging in showing you their work and catch of the day for a few Dalasi tip.

There are inside displays of wildlife, instruments and weaving and then a guided tour of the outside displays.  We were able to touch most of the inside displays which made for an interactive experience.  We were most impressed with the mock up of a village on the outside tour.  Our 11 and 10 year old children were engaged during the whole visit.  There was an opportunity to buy souvenirs at set prices (if you don't like haggling) which were of good quality and reasonably priced in our opinion.  We bought some cloth made by the weaver there.\nThe cost was very reasonable at D150 for adults and D25 for children.  Well worth a visit.",

          "text": "This market is touted as the largest in Banjul. It’s best to go with a guide or someone that knows the place as it’s easy to get lost in the winding alleys and narrow ways. There’s lots to see and buy. It’s such a busy market with  everything under the sun, available. The sellers are quite pushy as everyone wants you to buy something from them. Thing is, all sellers start their prices very high and you must haggle for the best price. When you’re given a price, cut it below half and start haggling from there. Also be ready to walk away if you feel you’re being charged too much. It’s a bit like poker, sometimes with all the bluffing going on just to buy stuff but it’s part of the way of Albert market. Worth a visit to buy souvenirs and keepsakes. ",

It can be quite stressful with all of the salesmen trying to get your attention. Therefore the guide is essential, even though he leads you to his companions in the market it helps. We went in the afternoon on a Monday and were practically the only people there. It was very special, I wouldn't say you have to see it. ",

The stall holders are friendly and in most cases low pressure, just come and look.  I buy most of my souvenirs here as I am given time to look.  I have had several wood articles carved at the market for me.  If the object wasn't done correct it is either fixed or another is carved.  Special items made usually take a couple of days.  There are a couple of market holders that will sell you items (especially cloth) that may not be the correct size for the price of a proper size so you do need to beware, but over all I found this market to be an excellent place to shop.  Please remember that even though the wood is from The Gambia most items are carved by the Senegalese.  I have some amazing pieces of work at home from the market ought at reasonable prices.",

There was no pressure to buy, but encouragement to look inside each shop - not onerous. The quality of goods is reasonable. Don't expect amazing works of art, but I bought a couple of lovely wraps/sarongs to wear on the beach, which were prettier and as good quality as anything I have seen in the UK. As others have said, bargaining is expected. No idea if I got a good price for the few things I bought, but I paid no more than the things were worth to me. \n\nAt the left of the market as you face it, is a small cafe which doesn't look anything but has a reliable and reasonably clean loo - handy if you have tummy trouble.",

          "text": "Like so many markets around Africa, and the world for that matter, if you have not been to many, this will be something new and exciting even though it is small. If you have travelled extensively, you might find it boring.\n\nI have travelled extensively but surprisingly found it a little interesting. I did not expect to see lots of new and original things I had not seen before, and I did not. It was pleasant though to get some fresh air in a small market that is less crowded and has more open space than most. I hated the fact that people wanted to bargain. I know some people enjoy that but I simply find it a waste of my time. Tell me your best price and I will buy if I like what I hear. Some of the stall owners did not heed this warning from me and lost my business. By the time I got past a few stalls, everyone knew they better just tell me what they really would charge. I ended up buying a small boat and some place mats.\n\nPlease do not buy any jewellery that supposedly is made from or has on it crocodile teeth. They sell parts of cow bone and then lie about its origins. When I confronted some of the people about this, one eventually admitted the truth. My taxi driver was also angry with them as he feels that, besides being dishonest, he could be tainted with the same brush just for bringing me to the market.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you are an experienced traveller or not, I would say go. Perhaps you see nothing new but at least you will have tried.",

The traders are still extremely polite but can be very pushy and the craftspeople who work in the market are still making wonderful stuff at a price that is unbeatable - but you do need to haggle. \nThe woodcarvers near the entrance are a lovely bunch of lads. They work so hard to produce really well made items. I commissioned a carved elephant and collected it the very next day. It might be as well to remember that there is a weight limit on planes as that almost turned into a very expensive elephant indeed. Fortunately I got away with it...\nDon't be afraid to haggle and remember that the price given for the goods on sale can be reduced if you push - just, not too much eh? Its better when both parties get a good deal.\nEnjoy the market and make sure you go right to the very end where there is a stall that promises no hassle. Just don't believe a word of it! lol.\nThe market takes about an hour or two to look around properly. I returned several times and found something new to look at on each occasion.",

So the best thing is to go around and see what is where available. \nYour second round you can decide what you buy where.\n\nIf you want to walk around at your pace, just tell them that you are looking around . \n\nwhen you want to buy make sure to cut the price . if it is to low, they will not sell, don't worry.",

I found it very overwhelming at first but grew to love it. Once you realise that they are genuinely just trying to make money to feed their families it becomes more understandable.\n\nSome of the wood carvings are works of art. Clothes are a bit hit and miss but perfect for holidays. Great for little gifts. Prices are higher than other Gambian markets as it is a tourist area. Be prepared to haggle, it is half of the fun. Keep your money close to you and enjoy the atmosphere. I've had great fun with some of the stallholders while waiting for things to be made for me. ",

There are shops on either side of the main street, but the market itself is off to one side and is a rabbit-warren of alleyways and stalls. You'll find just about everything on sale here but it is a great place to buy souvenirs. Some really good and colourful material on offer.\n\nThere are loads of sights and sounds. You'll probably find that young (and some not so young) men will offer to guide you around. It is probably worth accepting the offer of one of them, otherwise you'll find yourself pestered constantly and you simply won't be left alone to wander at your leisure. All they expect is a few Euros or dollars at the end of your visit.\n\nRemember that bartering is near-mandatory here. A good gauge is to pay about one third of what the seller first asks for. Be persistent. If you start to walk away, your offer will generally be accepted. Even so, things are good value and, generally, good quality.\n\nYou cannot visit Banjul without coming here.",

It is one of those market that purely shows you the way of life of the Gambian people. They sale old clothes, fish (mostly covered in flies), vegetables, nuts, household bits and pieces, cotton fabric and a bit of everything in between. You can even have some clothes made for you there as you will find some very talented dressmakers. This market will be a bit of a challenge for those who suffer crowds, noise and at time bad smell. Try to go in the afternoon as it is less crowed. If you find something that attract your fancy, don't forget to bargain... cut in half or more the price offered and get to a point that you are both happy with. Happy hunting.",

The advantage - you can find all of it in one place. The disadvantage - for people not comfortable with crowds, it can be a bit of an exercise. Vendors will call out, ask you what you want, show their wares. A lot of goods are cheap copies of famous brands but some shops also do keep originals if you have a keen eye. All in all a world in itself if you are unafraid to explore its winding by lanes. Happy Hunting!!",

You walk over rough ground through narrow channels between the traders and their stalls. They all call out to you to come and look at their wares and will almost plead with you to buy something and immediately start dropping the price even if you tell them you aren't buying, only looking. You have to be firm and walk away. I found it quite annoying because I really wanted to take my time and brouse properly. I might have actually spent more if I hadn't felt quite so hassled, but it's just a totally different culture. We had a guide with us who stepped in when he could tell we'd had enough of the hard-sell. I don't think I would have liked to go it alone! Not sure I'd want to go back either, which is a shame, but it's just not for me. As I said at the beginning though, don't be put off - go experience for yourself!",

The sellers will try and get you into their shop and force you to buy their goods.  If you don't want it, just a polite 'no thank you' and move on.  There is no fixed price on anything so they will ask you for your best price.  If you ask them to give you a price, barter down until you are satisfied.

The locals will hustle for business but in a milder manner than the stalls in Serekunda. It is not so hectic so you have more time to browse and consider. I wish more tourists visited the market as the locals there really need your business - many of them perhaps only selling one item a day,\n\nMy favourite stall was Roy's which is located towards the back (so make sure you don't leave him out or spend all your money too early!) He had a wonderfully carved giant crocodile that had taken him over 2 months to make. I would have loved to have purchased it but my budget would not have given him the fair price he deserved. He was also a very lovely man and advertises his stall as being 'hassle free' and that's exactly what it was.",

          "text": "I wouldn't necessarily say that this market is any cheaper than anywhere else ,nor would I recommend it for those of you who don't like a 'hand's on approach' to business... But if you are curious, I urge you to speak to some of these traders to find out the story behind it all. \n\nFor example, one individual, real name yusupha who calls his stall at the very back of the market 'Roye's' had carved a lifesize crocodile out of wood, it had taken him 3 months to intricately carve all the amazing detail and yet was prepared to start bartering at the equivalent of £25 for it (picture attached)\n\nSome reviews call some of these people's products tat or knock offs from serrekunda market. Please reflect on your ignorance for one moment.\n\nA lot of these people know anything else than the artistry of these crafts, they may be illiterate in some cases but can create amazing things. So spending an hour or so down this fascinating part of the otherwise westernised senegambia strip will truly open your eyes.\n\n There are some brilliant unique items to buy, which unlike the shops on the strip, go directly to the traders, who deserve it for their tireless effort. \n\nThey will be insistent, they will beg you to buy, but they appreciate your interest in their artisan trade equally. I do warn you though, that you probably won't leave empty handed, but for a fair price for everyone.",

The merchandise is mostly wood carvings, key rings, material bags and general touristic souvenirs. \n\nHowever it is such a shame because it's just not worthwhile rooting around given the amount of hassle you get to enter the stalls and buy something.\n\nVendors favourite words \"come inside it does not cost anything to look and then you go\" fat chance! You will be harassed to go in and harassed until you buy something!\n\nThey are very friendly people, the Gambians. However they have not realised that they are likely to sell more if they back off a little and let tourists browse.\n\nWorth a visit to see the market but we have been here for four days and still have not mustered the courage to return.

Having a local guide is helpful to guide you through the maize of paths.  Guides often help keep the people from hassling you.  While the meat and fish area may be smelly and upsetting for some, it is worth a visit.  This is one area in the country I had to be careful with taking photos.  The other side of the market opens to the beach area where you can see the larger boats and small boats unloading what they have brought in.  The market is Banjul at work!",

It was helpful having others that know good prices as they helped us bargain. The craft vendors especially will try to get the best of you and are much more aggressive than the other vendors. Be firm in your prices; they may try and tell you that they're losing money if they give it to you for the price you've suggested but of course it isn't true. For a small wooden figurine or a flashy beaded necklace for example, 100 Dalasi each is sufficient. For a beach wrap, expect to pay approximately 200 Dalasi.

          "text": "I had fun at this market, which is actually called Albert Market. It is not the usual kind of fun and you need to understand that it can be full of people on some days. Also understand that depending on where you go in the market, there can be strong smells of fish and meat, with flies in abundance sitting on the fish mainly. The market feels a little chaotic but if you go with someone who knows it, it is not bad. Do not expect to be wowed with amazing arts and crafts. This is a true third world market and some of the streets you might walk through are muddy with stones and holes randomly distributed. If you know where to go, you can also see a beach close to the market where boats arrive to sell their fish first to people waiting on the beach. You will also be able to see from this beach where the Atlantic Ocean and the Gambia River meet.\n\nIf you are not sure if this market is for you, ask yourself if you have seen a few third world countries and markets before. If you have, it should not phaze you. However, if this is your first experience of a third world country, it might come as a complete and overwhelming culture shock to you. Perhaps ask a taxi driver to walk with you and, if you feel you want to get out of there, you can then let the driver know. At least that way you have a quick escape.",

Paid the entrance fee, was then followed by a manager who asked for a donation for food - anything from 200 to 400D, I do not know what they spend the money on as there seems to be nothing here that they need to feed, apart from a few rescue animals (and only a few!). After a walk around, there is a visitors centre - where on entering you feel instantly pressured into buying a t-shirt or other souvenirs. About half way around there is a shop, and some people selling wood carvings. You cannot sit and have a drink here without being hassled into buying a wood carving. If you buy from one seller you then get hassled by the other seller to buy from them too as they need to money to buy food!. On exiting there are a number of wood carving stalls that you have to pass. The sellers come at you from all over - one dragged me to his stall by my arm and told me that he had not had any breakfast and asked if I would buy a simple darning for 'only 300D' so he could buy breakfast. DO NOT BUY FROM ONE OF THESE PRESSURE SELLERS OR THEY WILL ALL COME AFTER YOU FOR A SALE. On leaving the reserve, there are another two locals who will try and sell you chilled drinks for an upmarket price of D75 (they were only D20 in my hotel). Was a terrible day out, it would be a bit better if they cleared all the wood carving sellers away - or only let one or two sell - not around 10 that you have to pass on your way out, all selling the same things.",

Alot of second hand and chinese imports too (a growing scourge across our continent) and alot of colourful but  african outfits.

          "text": "Senegambia Craft Market is right on the beautiful tourist strip at Kololi.  To get there, head down the Bertil Harding Highway southbound until you get to the Senegambia Junction.  The Highway and Junction are bitumen roads straight from Banjul Airport, which really helps as many roads are not surfaced in Gambia.  The Craft Market is right on the crossroads and surrounded by Restaurants such as the excellent Gaya Art Café on the highway and popular African Queen Restaurant just around the corner near Totties Nightclub.  The Craft Market is in a thriving tourist area and there you will find many locally made souvenirs to buy and bring home while stopping off to have a drink or meal in the area on the way to or from Kololi Beach.  You can watch the wood carvers making traditional African masks and ornaments.  You may see sand painters at work, buy some art or hand-made jewellery, try some local food, buy fruit and juice, and see tailors sewing on treadle sewing machines making pretty sun dresses for women and children as well as traditional African clothing.  You can even have a tailor make you an outfit, and I have had a made-to-measure dress or two made there myself.  I can personally recommend Fatou Jagne who has a tailor’s business in the market as that is where I had my first traditional African outfit made-to-measure on a trip to Gambia.  Perhaps you will even catch some djembe players in action or just buy one of these beautifully made traditional drums to take home.  I’ve seen many wrapped up going through the departures queue at Banjul Yundum Airport.  The musicians are not there all the time, but the carvers who make the djembe drums might just show you how to play one if you want to try.  Prices there vary slightly and the traders can be haggled with but please do be polite and reasonable as they have overheads to pay, families to support and “hand-made” in any part of the world takes time.  Don’t forget that materials cost money too.  Their art and crafting is their job not a hobby and they are all very nice people keen to please.  One wood carver made me a wooden fish ornament for my brother while I watched, though fish were not his usual thing to carve.  The people working there are open to suggestions and keen to help.  The thing I like about it being situated right on Senegambia Junction is that at the side of the Craft Market there is a police checkpoint and the officers there will ensure that no tourist is hassled of harassed.  It’s one of my favourite spots in Gambia and I stay in the Kololi area frequently.",

Most of what is on sale is poor quality Chinese produce. Watch your personal belongings in the narrow alleyways and be sure to take a very tough line in bartering in the unlikely event that you see something worth buying.",

If people want to see the country as it is, an open mind is needed.  Here is the real Gambia and an active one where people are putting a lot of effort into earning a living.  Gambians are hard working people.  There is no state benefits system such as that in the UK, so the people in Gambia are very resourceful and productive.  The tourists really need to support their enterprise.  Comparing it to shopping experiences in the tourists' home country is unfair and unrealistic.  Tourists know the price of goods in their home country but many are not willing to pay the price when they go there and even expect to under-pay.  They see the local traders as \"husslers\" though they are just trying to make a living and they put a lot of efffort into it.  I would encourage tourists to support local industry, but also to do as they do at home - shop around!  Get friendly with a local person who knows where the bargains are.  Gambian ladies are always good to know and helpful, telling people where to find the best price for something they want to buy.  Banjul market is good, but also try Senegambia Craft Market on the Bertil Harding Highway.",

I would recommend going with a guide or a local taxi driver because they can help you barter for items and lead you to the right section if you are looking for a particular item. Banjul market is better than Serekunda if you are looking for gifts however if you want fabric I would recommend going to Serekunda instead because you tend to get better deals on fabrics in Serekunda.",

Which was great because a.) he knew his way around so we did not get lost & b.) he made sure that we did not get hassled, he also explained to us the way the market runs and explained what the produce was that was on sale.\n He then walked us along the beach to the port and back via the fishing village.\n\nA big eye opener on how they live and just how poor they really are.

My mom wanted to look at designer bags (which are fake here) but he brought us to the more local-market and we felt kind of uncomfortable in those narrow alleyways between stands and everyone looked at us. It smelled bad, too. He brought us to a stand with leather bags which were nice but I don't like to bargain and to be fair, I don't want a bag in the shape of a voodoo doll when I get back to Holland. So we asked our guide to bring us back to the main street. He didn't know what we meant with designer bags en seemed a bit lost so after two shops (who were nice and airconditioned) we asked to go. \nPrior to this we bought some fabric at a stand where our guide bargained for us so we could buy the nice fabric to be tailored into dresses. We paid 800 dalasi for 2 pieces. We had it tailored at the Senegambia hotel by Aida for 1350 (not each, but in total). ",

          "text": "Visiting the local market/souk or whatever they are called are always a must when traveling to exotic places - and the Banjul market as such resembles what you will find across Africa. It is hectic, noisy, smelly - and so interesting!\n\nObviously you have to fight off the beggars once in a while, but if you go with a determined mind they are not too hard to get rid off. It is not easy to know when you can take a picture and when not - and your eyes see so many things, your camera wishes to bring back home. But mostly you will have to keep those memories in your head to not risk offending the locals. \n\nIf however you shop non-tourist items you will not have to bargain, and the experience will be so much nicer. I brought back plastic dishes, mugs etc. at the ridiculous price of 30-40 euro cents each, and the seller did everything to make me happy finding the exact color and pattern I wanted!\n\nIt is however recommended to bring your taxi driver, as you will otherwise find yourselves with a lot of people talking to you only to later claim you own them money for guidance!",

Why not buy something that will make an excellent gift and save a life in the process?\nI'm suggesting that you visit Banjul market - go by bush taxi (part of the experience) and when you arrive walk along Old Perseverance Street in Albert Market till you come to the shop of Manneh Suwareh, dealer in 'bednets' - mosquito nets, in other words. The nets are well made locally, come in various shades and styles and make superb, life-saving gifts to your favourite hotel staff, village schools, hospitals or casual strangers. Mosquitoes kill people. We take anti-malarials and tend not to visit during the rainy season. Gambian village houses are built to let hot air out, Sadly, this enables mozzies to fly in. Buy a net, give a gift, save a life. Cost? About 200D - the price of a few drinks, and a fraction of the cost you would pay back home.\nManneh is a lovely man; he won't rob you - and you'll probably get a conducted tour of the market thrown in.",

Some shops sell wood carvings where you can see the owners sitting outside making items. Others sell woven items and leather goods that are quite good quality and are reasonably priced if you willing to haggle.  Another of the shops on the corner is run by a gentleman who makes woven items and you can watch him at work on his basic weaving machine.  The items are of surprising good quality.\n\nIt is not a place to make a special journey for, but well worth looking round if you are in the local area.",

TIP1. Keep you valuables' secured as my camera was stolen not from Banjul has to be said. and TIP2  make sure if entering Banjul you have ID on you especially if you are in a mixed race couple like me. But don't let that put you off please. was still a nice day out and if you go down some of the side streets in Banjul you will find bargains a lot cheaper than the tourist areas",

It's situated right by the roundabout a Bakau craft market and next door to Saffie j restaurant.\nThe shop sells sand paintings which are I believe are all crafted on site, it also sells wooden carvings and paintings.\nOur daughter first visited last year during a power cut but was invited inside to sit down and have a go at sand art for herself. She spent an hour making a very small picture by torch light.\nThis year she took lessons during the two weeks we were there. She learned all aspects of sand art and even how to dye the Sand!\nShe made a lovely picture during the time she spent there and also made a friend in Sheikh who was her teacher and is the son of the owner.\nWe paid 150 (£3) per hour and while she was busy with the sand we spent the time she was in there watching the world go by from Saffie j next door.\nThe day before we came home we were each given a bag of gifts by Sheikh and a lovely card. She was also given everything she needs to practice at home (including the different coloured sand hat she had prepared with him).\nPlease stop and have a look if you're passing this place, the amount of work that goes into these sand paintings is amazing. Have a couple of lessons and learn for yourself how it is done, it's worth every penny.",
