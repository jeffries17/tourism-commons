A weaver making cloth the traditionally way.  A reconstructed tradional hutted Village.  Entertainment in a cafe/ resting area by two drummers.\n\nThen went on to the fishing area by the shore.  Saw fish being smoked. Then the boats came in laden with fish.  Itâ€™s very busy with folk (mostly women, but guys with wheelbarrows) collecting the catch.  It got extremely crowded (but not as pungently awful as the smoking area).\n\nAn interesting experience.",

So, if you have time and opportunity, I&#39;d recommend a tour, even a day trip. You&#39;ll get a far greater, in-depth and more authentic experience, and a better understanding of this wonderful country.",

We also sat and listened to a Djembe drummer (they often have a full band apparently), and he was great fun.  A really good introduction to the Gambia.",

The displays in the natural history and agriculture sections are poor by any standards, consisting of poorly framed and fading photographs and a few skins. The reconstructed settlement of the 19th century is much better and was made more interesting by the guide who accompanied me. However you would be hard put to spend more than an hour here. I was soon in the central bar/entertainment area where a drum band was playing (for me). All a bit uncomfortable and although I would like to have helped by spending some money there was no &#39;shop&#39; or even any craft souvenirs available. A lack of funding is clearly a problem and such efforts to promote Gambian culture can only be commended and supported- just don&#39;t expect much. But in time things should change.",

The smell was awful but made the visit. We then walked down onto the beach where the fishing boats where either pulling in or were already there and the queues of people waiting for the fish to be offloaded, there were families of all ages moving around. A walk the the market area was also an eye opener, no ice for keeping the fish cold, just buy it a get it home seems to be the motto. The Gambians are a generally happy people and we were made to feel welcome, the women and some men are not keen on having their pictures taken so just be aware of that, ask first if unsure. All in all well worth a visit, I would have liked to have spent more time there or gone back but time didn&#39;t allow that.",

Children and young people pull the boats closer to the shore and wade into the sea with barrels and bowls to bring the fish to shore. A few dozen women huddle there, sorting, cleaning, and preparing the fish for sale. Anything unsellable is simply dumped on the beach. Buyers and sellers walk back and forth amidst the hustle and bustle. Others are busy cooking, barbecuing, or storing fish on ice. Although... there&#39;s not much ice involved, even in temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius. As a tourist, you can stroll around without any problems; no one will bother you. Feel free to take photos and soak up the atmosphere... literally. The real Gambia smell.",

You also have to opportunity to talk with the people over there or buy some table cloths or paintings. Entrance fee is almost free. Negative point however is that the museum needs maintenance, everywhere you look there was dust on the pictures and artifacts. However, when you ignore that, really nice to visit, certainly in combination with the Tanji fishing village.",

      "text": "The museum was established in 1997. It&#39;s Gambia&#39;s first private museum and tells a great deal about the country&#39;s history. Upon arrival, we were first told what we could find in the museum, and then we could decide whether or not we wanted to visit. We found this very kind. Admission costs 200 Dalasi for an adult and 50 Dalasi for children up to 12 years old. The museum itself is quite simple, and you shouldn&#39;t expect anything special, but it&#39;s still a very interesting and educational outing. There&#39;s information about musical instruments, shells, reptiles, birds, fish, and the various fishing nets, among other things. There&#39;s also an exhibition on weaving, where you can see a boy weaving at a loom and a blacksmith demonstrating his skills. Next to the replica of a traditional &quot;Bantaba&quot; (Madinka for resting place) under the trees is a small shop where you can buy souvenirs to take home. They also have a traditional Gambian compound where you can get a sense of how Gambians lived 150 years ago. In the museum&#39;s Bantaba, a group plays Gambian music, and you can order a drink and relax. We found it an interesting and, above all, educational museum, and it&#39;s definitely worth a visit. The museum gives you a good impression of traditional Gambia. The museum is also great for children, as there&#39;s so much to see and do; they won&#39;t be bored easily. If you visit the museum in the afternoon, it&#39;s worth going to the fishermen&#39;s market around 4 p.m. It&#39;s a truly colorful spectacle, and you simply must experience it.",

      "text": "We rode bikes across the beach from Kololi, and were met by the fishing boats coming in - there was no way of passing, so we watched the hassle and bustle, the fish being carried in from the boats in the sea in baskets, and being sorted on the beach by the ladies, and then taken off to stalls to sell. It was very colorful, and was fascinating to watch. We walked up through the beach area up towards the road, passing men repairing nets, and children playing, there were a lot of local people there who were mesmerized by two tourists cutting up through the smoke houses with bikes. We were taken into the smoking houses and the process of smoking was explained and demonstrated - it really is quite primitive but highly effective. We ate a smoked herring with a local, who I gave 100d to go and get some drinks from the local shop. He came back with three bottles of Coke, and handed me 70d change...I gave it to him for giving us such a nice tour of the smoke house. He was very pleased, and walked us up to the road, and waved us goodbye. We rode back to Kololi using the road. It was a great visit. To Tanji village, and a real joy to see how the fish are smoked, ready for export.",

You can get a feeling of life in the bush and how the local population live. If you have a local guide, plan your visit around the time when the fishing boats come into shore selling their fish. I have amazing photos of the museum and the fishing boats.",

      "text": "Along the Coastal Road, halfway between Tanje and Batukunku, the Tanje Village Museum (find it in Google Maps) was an unexpected and pleasant encounter; Greeted by the smiling welcome of the young curator, I paid a small entrance fee (GMD 200.00) and was accompanied on the tour of the premises. In addition to typical pictures, exhibits, cloths, costumes, agricultural tools, musical instruments etc. regarding the culture and the traditional ways of life of the major ethnic groups of the Gambia, I was surprised to find, actually, an ethnobotanical museum, with standing trees and plants utilized for building, alimentary, ritual and/or therapeutic purposes. I also watched a weaver busy with his craft and listened to traditional songs played by a band of musicians while sitting in the bantaba sipping tea and trying to appease my customary curiosity by firing unending questions at the knowledgeable guide. A modern extended family (owners of the museum) live in the same large compound enclosing the museum, and I could see men, women and children carrying out their daily chores and activities, thus transmuting a simple visit to a museum into a unique, &quot;unplugged&quot; experience. When I left the compound, I made a late discovery: lodges, a conference room and an ethnic restaurant are available for a full immersion museum â€“ and gastronomic â€“ adventure. Gambia, here I come!",

It seemed inaccessible; however, it does give a good impression of what has been built over the years, alongside local huts and such. From the museum, it&#39;s a short walk to the local fishing market. When you talk about an experience, they mean it. Hundreds of people together, in boats, on the water, on boats on land, and so on. And everywhere, stuff that we would have scrapped. West Africa at its best. Don&#39;t miss it!",

It is about a mile and a half from Tanji on the land side of the coast road going towards Kartong.",

      "text": "We spent almost a whole day discovering this museum. It looks small on the outside but is actually big. There are inside displays of wildlife, instruments and weaving and then a guided tour of the outside displays. We were able to touch most of the inside displays which made for an interactive experience. We were most impressed with the mock up of a village on the outside tour. Our 11 and 10 year old children were engaged during the whole visit. There was an opportunity to buy souvenirs at set prices (if you don&#39;t like haggling) which were of good quality and reasonably priced in our opinion. We bought some cloth made by the weaver there. The cost was very reasonable at D150 for adults and D25 for children. Well worth a visit.",
