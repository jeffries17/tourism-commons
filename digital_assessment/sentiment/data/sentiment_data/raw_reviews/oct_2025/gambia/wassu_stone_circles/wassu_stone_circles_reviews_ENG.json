      "text": "I found the stone circles interesting. I had a good guide who shared a great amount of knowledge about the stones. It's a small area but it's impressively clean and the stones seem to be well maintained. My guide said that it was maintained by the community and they are eager to share stories of the stones. It was interesting to learn about the area's history but be aware that the guide will speak at length, so let him know if you have any time constraints.\n\nPerhaps it was a miscommunication, but my guide said that he was a volunteer. I left a tip, but my driver said that they are paid. I'm not sure which was accurate.\n\nI would recommend a stop if you're in the area. I was a bit on the fence about going, but I'm glad that I did. It was something different to see in this region of Africa.\n\n",

We had a good stop here and also had a drink and lunch . We did notice a lot of the tours were just using it as a toilet stop and didn’t give the opportunity that we did with our tour guide, we saw some people that wanted to learn more but wasn’t allowed as it was a flyby for them, if this happened to myself and my husband I would of been so angry as you need to get to hear the history to understand the stones.\nIf you get the opportunity to visit this amazing place please take your time to talk to the stone man as his knowledge just wowed me. What I couldn’t get my head around was that all of the stones are in the sun but if you touch one it will be really hot and then another one will be cold .\nIt’s Gambia’s very own Stonehenge .",

      "text": "We drove from Farafenni to Wassu (Farafenni is about 3 hours away from the Kombo/Serrukunda, including a crossing at Barra). The journey took us about 2 - 2.5 hours. We made the mistake of not leaving for Wassu at crack of dawn, so the heat in the car was unbearable (no air con).\n\nWassu is a UNESCO site with several ancient stone circles that, according to the guide, are older than our Stonehenge -  5,000 to 7,000 years old (the building of these circles happened over 1,500 years).\n\nThe circles are in fact burial  mounds for kings and high ranking chiefs and only one circle has been dug, in the 1960s. Due to local beliefs and respect the other circles have not been excavated.\n\nThere is a very good and informative small museum on site (see my photos), and we could even get a cold beer. In the middle of no-where, in a country where electricity is a luxury, that was a very special treat.\n\nThe entry fee is small however unclear (the ticket stipulates one number but the guide charges more - I think for their services). It does not matter, we are talking peanuts, up to 300 GMD for two people.\n\nStunning special place. The stones themselves are beautiful, and to think that they are over 5,000 years old is mind blowing.\n\nI strongly recommend visiting Wassu, either by hiring a car or by organised tour from the Kombo. There are not many roads in the Gambia so it is very unlikely that one will get lost. It is 1,000% safe, the people are lovely and friendly.\n\nIt is not a big site but I needed more than an hour to cover the site, to see each circle and to take photos and videos to capture this beautiful site. However my husband, who was distracted terribly by the heat, would have been happy with a 30 minutes slot to cover the whole site.\n\nThe pile of small stones on the stones is a sign of respect from visitors.\n\nLast note - even though this is a UNSECO site, unlike Stonehenge, visitors can access each corner of the site and touch the stones freely.",

Licht wel in de bush bush. Met een rondreis kom je er langs. Via Arch reisbureau hadden wij een tweedaagse naar GeorgeTown geboekt en bezochten zodoende deze plaats. Alles naar wens verlopen.",
