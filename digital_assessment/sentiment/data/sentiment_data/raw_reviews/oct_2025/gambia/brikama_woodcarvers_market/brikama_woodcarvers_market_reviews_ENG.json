      "text": "The perfect place to watch the artisans at work and immerse yourself in their art. Much less touristy than the Senegambia Kraft Market. Bargaining is key, but try to squeeze through to the back (happy corner) for less pushiness and fair prices. A warm welcome with the typical Gambian smile... Worth buying souvenirs and enjoying the African woodwork. We return year after year and are always warmly welcomed. Highly recommended.",

Keep in mind that you should bargain, but don&#39;t go overboard, as they think it&#39;s a big price, and a difference of a few euros might not be too much for you.",

When we were there there were not many others around so traders were desperate for a sale, and even us, as seasoned travellers and hard hagglers, probably overpayed for a couple of things (as it felt harsh to haggle too hard), but it was a nice easy to walk around atmosphere, with plenty on offer.",

Personally I found that starting at a third of the initial price meant you ended up somewhere just over half the initial price suggested! Whatever you pay will however be a bargain! If you have the time, cross the main road (carefully!) and visit the livestock market.",

The wooden carvings are fantastic and if you want to make a little change to something, they are very accommodating. For example, I didn't like the face on a model I picked up, so they chiselled it off for me there and then!",

This is always greatly appreciated by the seller!\nIt is a little difficult to just browse here as all the sellers call out for you to visit their 'shop', however the atmosphere is friendly.  It can be hard to choose who to buy from as most of the 'shops' sell similar goods.  Try to haggle, I know it can be hard but it is actually good fun when you get into it for something that you really want to take home.  I'm never cut throat though.  If I would pay it at home then fair enough for me.\nEnjoy chasing a bargain!",

The Craft Market is not located at the Brikama Market (the daily market for all kinds of products), but rather on the outskirts of Brikama towards Farato. My recommendation: it&#39;s worth a visit; there are some very nice things to buy there. So go there.",

      "title": "Real Gambia",
      "text": "The Real Gambia That&#39;s what we experienced in our tremendous three week stay in February-March 2009. We were based in Brikama – a medium-sized town about 20 kms inland from the Atlantic and an hour south of the capital Banjul. It&#39;s a fascinating town with a vibrant feel but none of the tourist-area trappings and hassles. People are very hospitable and very warm to strangers – especially those who are respectful and show a genuine interest in life there. Our host, Abdoulie Sarr, is a young entrepreneur whose goals are to create a range of locally-based enterprises to enable visitors to genuinely engage in the life of an area: get to know local people in depth; learn something of a local language; be part of local events; explore the beautiful country areas, learn about a different culture and exchange experiences; and to spend their money in ways that benefit local people rather than international tour operators. Accommodation and Food (Vegetarians catered for) He provided excellent quality accommodation and three substantial meals a day whist we were in Brikama. Breakfast consisting of a choice of very tasty rice porridge or omelette was delivered to our accommodation every morning and we had the option of having the other meals brought to us or of eating with his family. My traveling companion is vegetarian and we thought this could be a bit of a problem; nothing could be further from the truth. He was served excellent food with his &#39;not even fish&#39; requirements fully respected and catered for. Local Life Eating with the family was much more fun and gave us the opportunity spending time talking with people and playing with the children. In fact, we spent a lot of time just talking and debating a wide range of subjects and laughing a lot– a real exchange! Brikama is a fascinating town to explore and Abdoulie&#39;s relaxed but efficient style meant we could go it alone or have him take us to specific locations of interest. Exploring The Gambia We wanted to see the country and Abdoulie organized a three-day trip into the interior traveling by local transport and combining road and river journeys. We enjoyed traveling in the normal vehicles that Gambians used and not in luxury coaches or 4X4s – much more real. Our trip took in the Wassu Stone Circles (evidence of ancient civilization here); the wonderful Janjanbureh Camp with its perfect location on the River Gambia and good quality accommodation and food; the historic towns of Janjanbureh and Kuntaur, the bustling &#39;crossroad&#39; town of Farafenni, the riverside Tendaba camp and the rural villages along the country&#39;s South road. Birds and Animals We saw hippos and crocodiles and a huge variety of bird-life along small backwaters that make the Gambia so attractive to bird-watchers Abdoulie was an excellent guide with a wealth of local knowledge and contacts which made the trip run smoothly and tailored to what we wanted to see we never felt we were being herded along on a package tour. Music Back in Brikama we became familiar with the local music scene seeing a number of bands and talking with the musicians. Brikama is major center for music using the Kora. A Real Experience The trip was a mind-altering experience into the way of life of a country with wonderful people and beautiful scenery in which the hospitality was outstanding and where we felt welcome and safe at all times. At the end we felt we had had a real experience and had got to know a place and some of its people in depth – a place that is now very special. Contact details Abdoulie Sarr provides a range of tailor-made options for accommodation, travel and local experiences across The Gambia and we highly recommend his professional yet personal approach.
