      "text": "I'm not sure what we missed as this received so many good reviews but we did not like this attraction.  The museum is very informative and worth checking out and that may be why so many people rate this experience high, but the crocodile portion is disturbing.  The crocs are so lethargic they seem to almost not be alive.  I can't imagine how they are so docile... they say it is because they are well fed, but I would think they would have to be way overfed or medicated to lay around as they do. As soon as we entered the \"pool\" area and saw the crocodiles like that we walked right through and then out of the park.  I understand that animal attractions can harbor a lot of feelings and I entered into this with an open mind but I can't recommend.",

It is only D100 per person to enter although when you get to the crocodiles you are asked for a donation for their food. It&#39;s all written down in a book so you feel as though it will be used appropriately. The museum is fascinating and worth spending time in each room, although is all written in English so you may want a translation tool if you are not able to read in English. It is worth not rushing to the crocodiles if you love nature and spend some time the other side of the pool as we saw numerous birds including two types of kingfisher. There are also monkeys and rather randomly goats. If you are in the area you should make the visit and from further afield it would be worth negotiating a price with a local taxi driver. We didn&#39;t have a guide nor did we feel that we needed one.",

      "text": "So, here we are, in the heart of Bakau, Gambia, and we have come to discover the famous Kachikally Crocodile Pool. It is incredibly fascinating. Imagine, a 9-acre site with a sacred pool, an ethnographic museum, a mini forest trail, and even a nearby refreshment bar. It&#39;s like entering another world. From the moment we arrive, we are immersed in this mystical atmosphere. Local Gambians told us that this place is renowned for its healing powers. People come here to seek blessings, and some infertile women even come to pray to conceive. It&#39;s impressive to see how important this place is to the local community. While exploring the pool, we were amazed to see about 80 crocodiles, some dozing on the banks. And the most amazing thing is that we are allowed to touch them! So why not? After our previous experience with the lions, nothing can stop us! These reptiles are fed exclusively fish twice a week, and despite their proximity to the salt marshes, the pool water remains fresh and inviting. However, not really wanting to dive among them, we simply approach from behind and touch them. The skin is less thick than I imagined, the scales remain flexible. To make the crocodile move forward, you have to press quite hard on the base of the tail. The history and legends surrounding this place are just as captivating. We were told how the pool sanctuary was revealed to the Mandingo Bojang family more than 520 years ago. Another story speaks of a supernatural entity, a female Djinn, who lost her child here, thus giving birth to the sanctification of the well. And the Kachikally Museum is simply remarkable. With its 1,000 historical artifacts displayed in four round African huts, it immerses us even deeper into the history of Bakau and the many ethnic groups of The Gambia. It&#39;s like a journey back in time, a total immersion in the local culture and traditions. Ultimately, our discovery of the Kachikally Crocodile Pool and its museum will remain etched in our memories as an unforgettable experience. It is truly a rare pearl, a treasure of The Gambia that we are grateful to have had the opportunity to discover. VOYAGEAVECNOUS.COM FB AND INSTA AUTOURDOMONDE2023",

After that it is a bit of a walk and you are among the crocodiles. They are very calm. Some seemed like living statues. You can touch them, they don&#39;t react to that (so no bother) The crocodiles are said to be so calm because they get a lot of food and therefore don&#39;t have to hunt (a crocodile can go days without food) so they lie there to digest. The crocodiles are also said to be vegetarian🤣 There is a book at the end where you can write your name and make a contribution. Thank you kindly. Don&#39;t expect too much.",

You get to walk a path with your guide around the place when suddenly you notice there is no fence between you and those crocodiles about 4 feet away.  Luckily, only a few are moving and you are really glad they were fed earlier in the day.  I would question your fitness as a parent if you brought your kiddos on your visit.  Just remember if you want to touch one (and people do) touch the crocodile as far away from its mouth as possible.  If you love Komodo Island and its free roaming dragons you will like this place.",

Our guide gave the woman at the door some money, so I don&#39;t know the entrance fee. Here, you see a bit of Gambian history through photos with English explanations and African masks. It&#39;s not much, to be honest. You quickly walk out the back to the crocodiles. It&#39;s fun to see them. There are a lot of them; around 100 are said to live there. We understand it&#39;s also a kind of sanctuary. There are also many &quot;handlers&quot; there. They are friendly and will help take nice pictures of you and the crocodiles if you like. You can also touch one crocodile (the albino one) for photos if you like. There&#39;s no charge for this. The crocodiles are everywhere (especially in the pond, which is covered in leaves, so you don&#39;t see them), and you simply walk around them. They tell you where to walk to stay safe. After about 20 minutes, you&#39;ve seen it all. Afterward, you&#39;re asked for a small donation to buy fish for the crocodiles. They also display a table with supplies (markers, coloring books, etc.). They try to get you to buy these for the children you&#39;ll see in Gambia. You can then share them. We didn&#39;t do this, but we did donate some money for the fish and the effort they made to take nice pictures of us.",

The entrance fee is only 100 DL (just over £1) and there is an interesting museum about the history of Gambia to go through before one hits the jungle trail. There is a well trodden path, through some huge trees and local monkeys until you hit the pool, where rangers will arrange for visitors to pose with and touch the crocs for some great photo opportunities. These are fresh water crocs and are fish eaters, and well fed. So humans are quite safe, but even ard visitors are told to keep well away from the crocs mouths in case you confuse the crocs and they take a bite. If you are lucky on your visit you may get to see Charlie the albino Croc. A good and cheap way to spend a couple of hours.",

      "text": "This was my 2nd visit to Katchikally Crocodile Pool once again it was a remarkable wondrous experience. We went quite late in the day plus it was Ramadan time so it was very quiet. We were the only people there. There was a 200 deductions entrance fee. Before going to see the crocodiles there is a small museum we walked around which consisted of 3 rooms with information about the area , pictures and a few historical artifacts. The whole way round we were accompanied by a cat. He literally walked everywhere with us until we got to the exit of the rooms. Instinctively the cat stopped at the door and left us to continue out towards the crocodiles. She obviously didn&#39;t know to go out there around the crocodiles, we stopped at a very far old massive cotton tree on the way towards the crocodiles. The young man who cared for the crocodiles were so informative and put us at ease as when we got out towards the crocodiles. On this occasion, there were plenty of them out on the land. We counted at least 12 crocodiles among leaves and against the trees. This was a scarily wonderful experience to be this close to the crocodiles, we even saw the albino crocodile which was so big. The young man showed us the crocodile eggs and told us about the crocodiles. We made a small donation towards feeding the crocodiles as they must go through a large amount of fish to keep them going. This was a fantastic experience. Definitely not for the faint hearted.",

      "text": "Located about 30 minutes from Banjul, in the Bakau district, the Kachikally Sacred Crocodile Pool is believed by the locals for its healing powers and as a place of last resort for infertile women who wish to conceive. the women seeking the special blessing are washed by trained women and are told not to shake hands with anyone in Bakau. Others with ailments come to the pool to seek luck and make offerings to the crocs in return. The walk to the pool is reached from the mail road by a 600-meter dirt pathway that is lined by poverty-stricken housing and dozens of young children approaching you asking for money or school supplies. The entrance wall is colorfully painted with wildlife scenes. Once inside, you walk on a path towards the pool where it is said that there are over 80 crocodiles in and around the pool but we only saw four small crocks. The well-fed crocs are docile. Visitors are allowed to touch or stroke the tail--not the head. Expect to spend about 30 minutes in the facility. Other than the few crocs there is not much to see. Worth a visit if you are in the area but otherwise not much to see although it is described as a popular tourist site. At the end of the tour the owner requests &quot;donations&quot; to feed the crocs.",

Entrance fee is 100 dalasi per adult (guides/drivers free). You don&#39;t need a guide for this attraction. There&#39;s a very small museum beside the park, a very short walk to the crocodile pool and that&#39;s all there is. You can “stroke” the albino crocodile, see others lying around in the sun and there&#39;s opportunity to make a donation towards the cost of feeding them. Allow 30-45 mins max for this attraction. Truthfully the poverty on the streets surrounding the park was more of an experience and impacting than seeing the crocodiles but that&#39;s the reality of living in The Gambia….for some life is very hard.",

      "text": "My wife and I visited the crocodile pool whilst on a recent holiday in Bakau. We hired the services of an excellent local tour guide, Babucarr Fofana. Babu&#39;s office is in a street kiosk directly in front of the Ocean Bay Hotel in Bakau. Babu took us on a walk around Bakau to see some sights we were interested in. We went to the National Botanical Gardens, where Babu organized for us to tour the gardens with the Director of the gardens, who explained the plant species we were viewing and the relevance of the plants to the Gambia ecology and economy. Babu then took us to the Bakau Community School and onwards to the Katchikally Crocodile Pool. Babu gave us a guided tour of the museum at the pool and then the pool itself. He is a very knowledgeable guide with excellent English. Babu said we would have the opportunity to stroke the crocodiles, but what he hadn&#39;t told us was that they are free to roam the grounds. At first we found this a little alarming, but the pool guide explained that the crocodiles were fed every morning and that they would then not be interested in people unless disturbed. Indeed, all the crocodiles were sunning themselves and quite amenable to being stroked....carefully. The purpose of the pool and the crocodiles was explained to us and its continuing importance in Gambian folklore and society. All in all an excellent and interesting trip.",

      "text": "After paying 100 dalasi each, we passed the small museum walking along a smooth shaded lane to the pool entrance. Here we were with by the middle aged caretaker who gave us a 15 minute tour that included touching the back of a well fed male albino crocodile who was resting peacefully among 15 more of normal color. He showed a video of their morning feeding, tossing plump fish from a full wheelbarrow as the crocs emerged from the pool in increasing numbers. He then guided us along the pool trail pointing out the unapproachable aggressive females and several semi submerged crocs among the 80 that live around this pool. Further along, we stopped to admire an old Kapok with huge buttress roots when a monkey appeared that was nursing babies. Finally we were shown a rice field(matured at the end of the wet season) soon to be harvested and prepared for planting dry season vegetables. Before departing, we signed a book to make a small contribution to feeding the crocs. Delightful ½ hour visit.",

      "text": "I&#39;m pretty annoyed that entrance fees are being sold on this website for €16, but the owner of the crocodile farm knows nothing about it. I was there and the entrance fee is €2/100 dalasi. He uses that money to farm everything. Not a single one of the €16 reaches them. I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s going on???? By what right do the Germans enrich themselves at the expense of already poor people? Here a loaf of bread costs 10 dalasi/18 cents. €16 converts to 878 dalasi, so someone here would be very rich. The residents here eat rice for lunch, afternoon and evening, usually with sorrel or a fruit sauce. They can&#39;t afford milk or any other vegetables/fruit. What do you all say about this? I&#39;m of the opinion that you should only book and pay there, and at €2, donations are very welcome. If you donate the €16 on site, you know that the money actually gets there. No one has to queue here. This also applies to the so-called safari tours, which include this farm. I interviewed the owner, so I know. I wanted to know how much the entrance fee was and whether I needed to change money. I was and still am deeply shocked by this result. You wouldn&#39;t dare do that in Germany, as you can sue for damages. But I think it&#39;s the most audacious thing to line your pockets at the expense of such poor people.",

The small museum directly after the entrance provides interesting details about the traditions of Gambia&#39;s various tribes. Furthermore, if you keep your eyes open, you might spot a variety of birds and, with luck, other animals as well.",

Pool where you can’t go close to them as they are aggressive (well that’s their nature right?) and then where you can see babies.

Det er altså ingen gjerder eller stengsler mellom besøkende og krokodillene. Then you can see what you&#39;re looking for, but you don&#39;t have to worry about it. Er det virkelig trygt? Og har de gjort noe med krokodillene for at de skal holde seg rolige? Ikke vet jeg, men jeg skal ihvertfall ikke tilbake hit. ",

From the entrance, there&#39;s a pretty good museum you can walk through about the history of Gambia. If you bring your own taxi driver (he gets in free), he can explain more. Then you enter a kind of small park with a lake where some crocodiles lie in or near it. If you want to pet one (which doesn&#39;t eat meat, but fish), you have to wait in line for your turn. After petting, you have to sign your name in a book and pay. You&#39;ll be back outside in half an hour. The &quot;pool&quot; is in a poor neighborhood; children will rush at you the moment you get out of the taxi. Bring some wrapped cookies, candy, or lollipops—they&#39;ll be very happy.",

Det var en ”krokodilguide” på dishes, så det var inte så attt man kunde springa runt och klappa hur som helst. Själv höll jag mig lite på avstånd. Respect! Krokodilerna matas varje dag och det går åt 250 kg fisk dagligen. De matas interme med kött. Detta skall göra krokodilerna mätta och det är därför de är dåsiga och inte attackerar folk. Dock såg vi en som verkade aggressiv, men den gillade inte attt bli störd. Området är inte stort, men det ska finnas ca 80 stycken där.",

      "text": "The &#39;Katchikally Sacred Crocodile Pond&#39; may not be the most spectacular activity in Bakau, but it is certainly special to walk among six crocodiles and rub or pet one or more (on their backs). Where else can you do this? We visited Katchikally as part of the half-day Orientation Tour organized by African Adventure Travel &amp; Tours. We booked the tour through the Corendon tour guide; price: €30 per person. This visit is part of the local color of the coastal town of Bakau and is therefore highly recommended. You can also do this on your own; it&#39;s a 20-minute walk from the Sun Beach hotel (Kofi Annan Street) to the pool. It might be advisable to have a local guide (you can find them everywhere near the hotels), as the last 500 meters lead through some alleys and alleys – at least by our standards – where you might not feel completely at ease. The pond isn&#39;t particularly large; you can walk all the way around it in less than 10 minutes. A guide will explain its history and the water&#39;s supposed fertility-promoting properties. So, anyone who wants to shower with this water is welcome to do so. A small museum has been set up at the entrance. Unfortunately, due to the limited English spoken during the tour, some of the information is overlooked. But having a photo taken with a crocodile is always a souvenir...",

I got a lot of insights during this visit, and I am thrilled to understand some of the differences and similarities between the different tribes.\n\nWalking towards the crocodile pool we passed a -huge- tree with a hollow body that could encircle ten of us (photo session time), a lots of other trees and lianes (shadow!), and fields were the women work with the family crops (photo session time).\n\nThe crocodile pool was at first glance not that much to talk about, but suddenly they were crawling up to meet us and there were crocodiles everywhere. Cool and a bit scary :)\n\nIf you want to be close to a crocodile, go here. If you dont, stay home.\nAnd, dont be stupid, they are still crocodiles even when they are recently fed ;)",

On the walk from the museum to the crocodile pond there&#39;s a very interesting tree trunk formation which you can walk inside. Don&#39;t miss it. I was so busy walking and talking to the guide I didn&#39;t realize til I was right upon the crocodiles! I thought my heart would stop. They were laying across the couch, motionless with their mouths wide opened (this is how they cool off). There were some others with their mouth closed and the pool guide invited us to come stroke them. It took me over 15 minutes of coercion to gently touch one with my finger. The guides are really good, patient and knowledgeable. There&#39;s a little gift shop there. I found it impossible to relax at all whilst there as I was so scared but once I&#39;d left a sense of adrenaline overcame me and I couldn&#39;t believe I had braved it. Guide took a great photo of the inside of one of the opened mouths. Good, clean toilet.",

      "text": "Okay, touching a crocodile is a truly amazing experience, to be honest, but personally, I wasn&#39;t particularly impressed with the crocodile pool. Perhaps the surroundings were a bit too small for me. At the entrance, you first encounter a museum, then you see some truly enormous trees, and then you arrive directly at a small pond with a dozen crocodiles basking in the sun. It all felt a bit unnatural, even though it&#39;s naturally occurring. It&#39;s probably also due to the fence you walk past to reach the crocodiles... Incidentally, it&#39;s a sacred place for the Gambians, and they&#39;re positively focused on finding the right partners and having healthy children! That mindset is certainly beautiful!😊",

Когда мы пришли, крокодильчики ждали на берегу, и каждый из нас мог контактировать с этими  \"милыми существами” на сколько хватит фантазии и смелости. Я тихонечко подержалась за хвост и впечатлений мне хватило.",

It started with a walk (15 minutes) through &quot;the real africa&quot; where the Gambian people lived their day to day lives. This walk was a big &quot;eye-opener&quot; and gave me and my girlfriend a lot of emotions, to see how they REALLY live. You can&#39;t experience that at the hotels. Then we arrived at a small museum where we learned about The Gambia. And after that we meet the reptiles. It&#39;s crazy how close you can get to these beasts. But it&#39;s very safe and the owners are there to comfort you, haha. I can really recommend this trip. And I want to give a big shoutout to our new friend JoJo. He made our Gambian vacation a lot better. If you want to experience The Gambia I really recommend you guys to contact JoJo.",

The little museum was interesting - our guide explained about the musical instruments and tribal culture and then you go to see the pool which is still considered sacred by the locals. I would question the taking of tourist pictures with the crocs on the bank and suspect that the creatures are doped up in some way to make them docile and allow people to get up close to them. There were hordes of people milling around when we were there which seemed a little surreal. Worth seeing for the experience but like I say, I do question the photo taking......",

The crocodile park itself is amazing, your literally a few feet from them and if you work with the guides you can actually touch them. Was a shame to see a few tourists not abiding by the guides requests/rules and putting themselves into dangerous situations so please listen to the guides as they are experts with these animals and are extremely aware of keeping them safe too.

Ei hinnalla pilattu jos ei ole ennen krokoja koskenut. Kannattaa ottaa autokuljetus puistolle, n. 5 eskoo per nenä. \nLazy crocodiles and small museum about Gambia history. ",

You can see them in the crocodile pool swimming by. Before you get to the crocodiles there is a very interesting museum with history of The Gambia and it&#39;s men who contributed to the war for England. A place with traditional musical instruments and another room with cultural jujus. The guides are very good and will take you for photos with the crocodiles. I would recommend a visit here when visiting The Gambia.",

But mine was booked through our Gambia experience rep and included the crocodile pond and museum tour. These fish eating crocodiles! once fed are quite content to bask in the shade while tourists mingle with them and touch their bodies. It&#39;s quite surreal and has a complete disregard for eleven n safety or so it appears. The museum is small and informative on the history and culture of the country. Other stops include markets and a tea and coffee stop at a waterside lodge and a traditional wrestling match which was fun. A beach stop to a very pretty beach was some drive and a decent lunch provided. The last stop to a fishing village was canceled due to time. Travel was in an open top bedford lorry which was also fun, generally a good experience despite a little expensive.",

Then you go to the pool and there are over 100 crocs just basking in the sun. You can stroke them. Some people just lark about which is really pathetic as these are wild animals. Well fed on fish but still not to be messed with. Some fools think they are Crocodile Dundee and naturally the guides tell those people off. The crocs seemed happy enough to me. It is a marvellous place and I will go back many times",

      "text": "The town of Bakau, just 12 km from Banjul, the capital of The Gambia, hosts an interesting site. A pool with crocodiles, which inexplicably allow themselves to be touched and petted. The pool is named Kachikally (also Katchically or Katchikali) and belongs to the Bojang family which has been administering it for 500ish years. The site is promoted to be a sacred pool in which barren women can bath to wash away whatever has been holding them back from conceiving. After performing the sacred ritual bathing, she is told to remain faithful to her husband and not to shake hands with other men for a year. Faithfully adherent should bring her a child. Required elements of the ritual includes bringing “a humble petition” of “Kola-nuts and other small offerings” to the Bojang family. Entering, I was met by a guide who collected my entrance fee and led me about a hundred yards to the pool (after I suggested that I would visit the museum at the entrance at the end of my visit). The pool and its surrounds are a kind of oasis in the middle of the town. The approximately 9 acre site is surrounded by trees and swamp-like growth and you quickly forget that you are in the middle of a populous town. Right in front of the pool lie the main attractions, 2 meter long crocodiles sunning themselves with their mouths wide open (which is their way of keeping cool). I was the only visitor at the time, but it was starting to see several guides seated just 8-10 feet from these reptiles which strike such fear in southern US States and which generate headlines when their encounters go horribly bad for locals (and often their pets) caught by surprise. I took a step closer, and then another one. Then there I was, bending over and petting a live crocodile, smiling at the camera as my guide took my picture. As I said, I can&#39;t explain why I became complacent. It just seemed perfectly natural to wander around the crocodiles, touching them, asking questions, and staring into their gaping, tooth filled mouths. Their semi-catatonic state made me think that perhaps they were sleeping (though their eyes were open and eerily followed you as you moved around). I asked my guide about this, and he smiled again (in fact, I think he never quit smiling). He asked me to get my video camera ready. He said that they were always alert, and ready to pounce on food to which they would be alerted based on the vibration it would make when it hit the ground. Sure enough, he tossed a stick, and as you can see in the video in my blog, they jumped when it hit the ground, and only stopped when its smell didn&#39;t register as food. I have more information about Kachikally in my blog, including a list of reasons you may want to visit and a video of how active the crocodiles are. The link is in my profile.",

There are dozens of crocs here, most of them down in the pond which is fenced off so you can look down without fear of them approaching or you falling in... There are also 1 or 2 up at the top where the guides allow you to go to close to them and take pictures as well as touch them. Crocs are fed a lot of food on the morning so they are not interested in attacking (or even moving), hence the guides assuring you of your safety (They aren&#39;t drugged despite the bad reviews) Definitely worth a visit with a tourist taxi rather than a big group, there were less than 10 people there when we visited, well worth spending an hour or so there",

Which is good because I’m not doing it again either!\n\nThis was a real highlight. The animals are well cared for and are not drugged or mistreated. Definitely something to do whilst visiting locally. ",

There&#39;s even one (perhaps more) walking around with a missing leg because someone else bit it off in a fight. Our kids and we thought this was a really fun and adventurous excursion.

Quite an experience.\n\nWhat I feel should be mentioned is the little tour of the history of The Gambia as well as the people that you walk through efore getting to the crocs. Its well worth it to get someone knowledgable to take you through the little museum they have there.\n\nNo doubt the crocs are the main attraction but why not get a history lesson as well?\n\nI think we paid D100 as an entrance fee. You'd be mad to pass up on this!",

The guides claim they only eat fish and don't touch meat but he wasn't prepared to take the £100 on offer to prove it by swimming across.\nThe opportunity to get up close and actually touch a crocodile. They do seem very tame but no doubt can 'turn' at any time so be careful. \nThere's supposed to be a large albino croc called Charlie present but we didn't get to see him as he only appears at feeding time they say.\nLots of little crocs around out of the pool just basking in the sun. Don't walk off the beaten track though as you could easily stumble upon a nest of eggs with the mother watching over them. There's also a few snakes around so perhaps put on some long trousers for protection.\nSmall entry fee of 100 Gambian Dalasi (around £1.50)\nNice little museum at the entrance charting some of the history of the area and the influence of the British under colonial rule.",

You are allowed to touch the crocodiles and definitely pictures are allowed this is with the assistance of a tour guide. You can make voluntary donations that goes towards the feeding of the crocodiles, they are fed only fish. I will say it was yet again a beautiful experience. ",

The museum reflects Gambian history, customs, and traditions throughout history with photographs and various exhibits, highlighting the musical instruments, including a kora, large ceremonial drums, and a 1.5-meter-long wooden xylophone. You can see masks and traditional clothing. But the truly spectacular part is seeing the crocodiles found both in the pond and on its banks. The tour is accompanied by a guide who will tell you which crocodile you can touch. After touching it and seeing its motionlessness, I initially thought it was stuffed. When I mentioned this, the guide made it move, and it was truly impressive to see the crocodile with its jaws open so close to me. They explained to me that they are Nile crocodiles and can grow up to four meters long.",

It is a small pool with a large number of crocodiles in a fairly small area. 200d to enter the site, where there are a number of huts displaying Gambian history before visiting the pool. On reaching the pool a guide approached us and showed us around the pool. The crocodiles are well fed and very docile to the extent that they can be touched",

At the entrance, there&#39;s a mini museum with costumes and photos that gives us a glimpse into the past life of these people. I highly recommend it.",

On the way there, you pass through a very poor neighborhood with open sewers and garbage everywhere. Once you arrive at the park, you first visit the museum. It was interesting, about the history of the park and Gambia as a republic. There are also many handmade musical instruments. Walking through the park, you come to the crocodile pool. There are many crocodiles, and you can even touch one. The guide told us a lot about the park; it seems that women who would like to have a child can wash in a special area with water from the pool. Someone walks around asking if you would like to contribute to the fish they have to buy every day. As long as they&#39;re full, they obviously don&#39;t eat tourists... On the way back through the neighborhood, whole hordes of children chased us, asking for candy, and people trying to sell you notebooks for the children. It was nice, but not spectacular. Another tip: apply DEET. Because of all the water, there are mosquitoes. ",

With his permission, I was allowed to share his phone number. You can reach him via WhatsApp at 002209822596. He drives smoothly and is very familiar with the area. He knows many people and charges a fair price. Highly recommended.",

Although it was a great place to visit, I couldn&#39;t help but feel that some of the animals were sedated. It just don&#39;t seem right a load of people being able to go and touch a crocodile, but again, having said this it was also a fantastic experience to do such a thing. They do ask for a donation, although this is optional. I would like to think that at least half of the donation is put towards the crocs food. The surrounding area is a bit of an eye-opener, but do give you the chance to see up close how the not so fortunate locals actually live. It is worth going for the experience and close up site of these amazing creatures up close, just remain a bit open-minded by the experience. Tip If you are staying in or near the Senegambia Beach Hotel, get &#39;Del-Boy&#39; to organize the tour for you. Well organized and worth the money. He is always down on the beach.",

      "text": "Katchikally is one of those &#39;must see it&#39; excursions that are thrust upon every visitor to the Gambia and, to be fair, it is an interesting way to spend an hour or two. Just don&#39;t expect a major tourist attraction - and we didn&#39;t find any toilets! Quite simply, this is a rather muddy pool surrounded by trees and occupied by an assortment of tame crocodiles that do very little. It is apparently used for fertility rituals and is owned by one of the wealthiest families in Gambia Yes, you can touch the crocodiles if you feel brave. You will be surrounded by other visitors most of the time and the &#39;keepers&#39; will try (insistently) to sell you handmade crocodile teeth necklaces and other overpriced craft items. I was slightly perturbed by the keeper&#39;s insistence that we should give him a &#39;donation&#39; to pay for the crocodile&#39;s fish, especially as we had just paid to get in. Was this official or just another Bumster trick? I suspect the latter! The best bit for me was the small museum at the venue&#39;s entrance. There are some interesting examples of local drums and musical instruments with some ceremonial costumes. I was particularly fascinated by the display of old photographs. For me, this was worth the entrance fee on its own. In short, Katchikally is a tourist trap, but a relatively gentle one. The crocodile custodians are generally pleasant and you will almost certainly enjoy your visit.",

Oppaan johdolla niitä sai koskea ja silittää, mikä oli ihan jännittävää. Charlieta, isointa ja vanhinta krokotiilia emme nähneet, oli kuulemma jossain lammikon keskellä veden alla todennäköisesti. Kierroksen lopuksi toki sitten pyydettiin \"vapaaehtoista\" lahjoitusta paikan toimintaa tukemaan. Monessa kohtaa näki, että turisti oli esim. antanut 100 dalasia, mutta summaa oli jälkikäteen korjailtu ylöspäin. Ovelasti luotiin ryhmäpainetta lahjoittaa isompi summa?",

The guides have time to show you around and tell something about the crocs.\n\nIf you take of one of the locals to take you there you can stay away from the tourist traffic days. I wouldn’t wanna be there when there’s a group of 20-30 tourist that just got there.\n\nThat said, it’s good fun and a good thrill. Even though they’re well fed with fish, it’s still an exciting event to be able to touch them and feel the skin of these prehistoric survivors.\n\nEntrance fee is about 100 dalasi.\n\nThis includes the museum with some of the festive and traditional clothing, music instruments and the juju (voodoo) department.",

The road are terrible and if you have to walk you realize you walking along open sewer. First thing to visit is the museum that gives a good impression of the area in the old days. When you walk along you will find the crocodiles that have been fed already so you are able to touch them. Around the pool it is relative clean but the garbage has been thrown into the behind the trees it looks like a garbage disposal area. Still touching the crocodiles is a special experience.",

      "text": "This was my second time to Gambia and I couldn&#39;t miss to visit this place one more time. Last time it was summer so the pool was not full of water but this time it was raining and the experience was simply amazing. The pool was full of water so could not see the Crocs lying on the side. You enter the park by paying a nominal fee and if lucky find crocodiles walking along with you on the side or may be just lying next to the walking path. They are harmless until she is a female. Female is more into defense to protect her eggs. You reach near the pool and find so many of them just lying over there, may be waiting for you to sit besides them and have your pictures taken. Believe me, it is an amazing experience regardless you like animals or not. These Crocs are never fed meat and they eat almost 3,000 Kg of fish daily (that&#39;s what rangers told, not sure how much true it is). Please make sure that the rangers are around and guide you which Croc to be with while taking the pictures. Stay away from the female Crocs. If the water level is a bit low in the pool then you can go close by and see many Crocs walking towards you from the water or the side. There is nothing to worry about but you must need to take precautions while with animals. There is a small shop that sells crocodile tooth and they are not expensive, may be around 150 - 200 dalasis. They also ask for the donation and have maintained a register of donors. They have a nicely maintained museum in the front that depicts many ancient and authentic articles including weapons, cooking vessels, musical instruments etc. There is also a history of Gambia associated with it if you are interested in it. It is a belief of the locals that a lady who is not able to conceive a baby can visit this place and take a dip in the pool to be an expectant mom in the future.",
