You will definitely have to haggle for prices, once they know you're a tourist they always add on 5 times the price so I'd advice if the craft man says 3000 dalasi price it down all the way to 500 till you get to a reasonable price. It is definitely a good place to buy art work but be ready to haggle! ",

Some shops sell wood carvings where you can see the owners sitting outside making items. Others sell woven items and leather goods that are quite good quality and are reasonably priced if you willing to haggle.  Another of the shops on the corner is run by a gentleman who makes woven items and you can watch him at work on his basic weaving machine.  The items are of surprising good quality.\n\nIt is not a place to make a special journey for, but well worth looking round if you are in the local area.",

I buy most of my souvenirs here as I am given time to look.  I have had several wood articles carved at the market for me.  If the object wasn't done correct it is either fixed or another is carved.  Special items made usually take a couple of days.  There are a couple of market holders that will sell you items (especially cloth) that may not be the correct size for the price of a proper size so you do need to beware, but over all I found this market to be an excellent place to shop.  Please remember that even though the wood is from The Gambia most items are carved by the Senegalese.  I have some amazing pieces of work at home from the market ought at reasonable prices.",

    "text": "I went early, about 9am as the little shops were opening. It was quiet and cool at this time. There was no pressure to buy, but encouragement to look inside each shop - not onerous. The quality of goods is reasonable. Don't expect amazing works of art, but I bought a couple of lovely wraps/sarongs to wear on the beach, which were prettier and as good quality as anything I have seen in the UK. As others have said, bargaining is expected. No idea if I got a good price for the few things I bought, but I paid no more than the things were worth to me. \n\nAt the left of the market as you face it, is a small cafe which doesn't look anything but has a reliable and reasonably clean loo - handy if you have tummy trouble.",

    "text": "Like so many markets around Africa, and the world for that matter, if you have not been to many, this will be something new and exciting even though it is small. If you have travelled extensively, you might find it boring.\n\nI have travelled extensively but surprisingly found it a little interesting. I did not expect to see lots of new and original things I had not seen before, and I did not. It was pleasant though to get some fresh air in a small market that is less crowded and has more open space than most. I hated the fact that people wanted to bargain. I know some people enjoy that but I simply find it a waste of my time. Tell me your best price and I will buy if I like what I hear. Some of the stall owners did not heed this warning from me and lost my business. By the time I got past a few stalls, everyone knew they better just tell me what they really would charge. I ended up buying a small boat and some place mats.\n\nPlease do not buy any jewellery that supposedly is made from or has on it crocodile teeth. They sell parts of cow bone and then lie about its origins. When I confronted some of the people about this, one eventually admitted the truth. My taxi driver was also angry with them as he feels that, besides being dishonest, he could be tainted with the same brush just for bringing me to the market.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you are an experienced traveller or not, I would say go. Perhaps you see nothing new but at least you will have tried.",

    "text": "You could easily walk past this little shop with its corrugated iron walls and roof! It's situated right by the roundabout a Bakau craft market and next door to Saffie j restaurant.\nThe shop sells sand paintings which are I believe are all crafted on site, it also sells wooden carvings and paintings.\nOur daughter first visited last year during a power cut but was invited inside to sit down and have a go at sand art for herself. She spent an hour making a very small picture by torch light.\nThis year she took lessons during the two weeks we were there. She learned all aspects of sand art and even how to dye the Sand!\nShe made a lovely picture during the time she spent there and also made a friend in Sheikh who was her teacher and is the son of the owner.\nWe paid 150 (£3) per hour and while she was busy with the sand we spent the time she was in there watching the world go by from Saffie j next door.\nThe day before we came home we were each given a bag of gifts by Sheikh and a lovely card. She was also given everything she needs to practice at home (including the different coloured sand hat she had prepared with him).\nPlease stop and have a look if you're passing this place, the amount of work that goes into these sand paintings is amazing. Have a couple of lessons and learn for yourself how it is done, it's worth every penny.",
