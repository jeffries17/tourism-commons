But they seem to prefer sitting in a circle and discussing things rather than taking action, as we saw. But at least there are several interesting birds and a few monkeys to admire.",

Soon we were able to distinguish the breeds.  He gave us info on likely trading prices and the keys to pricing cattle. We also strolled around sheep and goats, and had a great time taking pictures of animal antics. \nThis is a great piece of a trip to The Gambia",

If you love leaves, knock yourself out. There&#39;s a crocodile pool where you won&#39;t see crocodiles. There&#39;s an &#39;education center&#39; where a man will ask for maintenance donations stood next to a couple of torn posters that haven&#39;t been replaced in 30 years. And of course, next to all this non-learning, there is an &#39;opportunity&#39; to buy stuff you don&#39;t want. Then more walking until finally you get to the world&#39;s most depressing zoo - where they&#39;ll tell you some thoroughly unconvincing nonsense about why these baboons needed to be in an enclosure rather than just free. Clearly just an excuse to get tourists there and to have them buy peanuts to feed them with. Felt really sorry for them. And there&#39;s the three pens with hyenas and vultures co-existing (emphasis on &#39;existing&#39;). Can&#39;t see how anyone but the most ardent fauna and bird fan (not that we saw many of those either) could get anything out of this place. Avoid and do literally anything else.",

If you hike through it alone and are quiet (i.e. without a guide), you&#39;ll find fascinating animals. You need time. The enclosure is an imposition for me as a conservationist. I didn&#39;t even take a closer look. I don&#39;t need that. The monkeys disappear immediately when you get closer. But with time and luck, you can see them very close. Unfortunately, I was too late for the birds; you should have been there earlier, around 8 a.m. The entrance fee is 45 dal. A taxi from Serekunda costs 300-400 each way, depending on negotiations and traffic. ",

      "text": "Myself and my partner enjoy nature reserves and also sighting animals and so we believed that this would be the perfect place to visit. We got a taxi there and the taxi driver would wait 2 hours. This was fine. It all went wrong after this! The park is 35D each which is fine but then they are white tourists coming and then the coming starts! Suddenly the price was 370D and forced into having a guide and paying for the taxi driver who wasn&#39;t even joining us! Apparently it is too “dangerous” to go without a guide. Then after this rip off we had to hire binoculars for all the birds and wildlife we will be seeing. Another 100D! So far it has cost quite a lot more than expected. First impressions seem run down so I now wasn&#39;t expecting much and was annoyed at being ripped off. What followed was a walk with a very sweaty guide with foul body odor who spoke not very good English. What I could make out was mostly about palm trees and the English man who originally founded the park just over 40 years ago. We were taken to the crocodile pool. No crocs to be seen. Disappointing. Two birds in the distance - use the expensive binoculars. Surprise, surprise they don&#39;t work! We were then ushered into a dreadful “gift shop” selling over priced junk and almost forced to buy something. With a very poor booklet at 450D we just gave a 200D donation to get out of the room! After this it was a boiling hot walk through a sandy path with more nonsensical waffling from the smelly guide. We saw some monkeys in trees but this was it. The walk led (after what seemed like ages) to an abysmal excuse for a zoo. Hyenas in cages with vultures and baboons in another cage. Such cruel conditions. Some monkeys roamed around wanting to be fed which resulted in another attempt to take money from us. We refused. A man was trying to sell wooden ornaments. I didn&#39;t even bother looking at them. Was so disappointed with this place. Luckily the guide didn&#39;t demand a tip at the end otherwise the tip would have been - this place needs shutting down. ",

      "text": "I visited Abuko after the beautiful canoe trip through the mangroves near Lamin Lodge. It was already past 11 a.m., and the sun was high, meaning high temperatures and very harsh light. I went to photograph the local birdlife, but given the hot weather, I literally saw two swallow-tailed bee-eaters, a pair of lily pads, and a squacco heron. In short: my planning and timing were very poor. Judging by the many beautiful photos on various online nature forums, Abuko is phenomenally beautiful. I&#39;ll definitely try it again on my next visit to Gambia.",

Я живо представила себе, как что нибудь ужасное сейчас выскочит, выпрыгнет или не дай Бог выползет, но если поднять голову вверх светит яркое  африканское солнце и на фоне голубого неба очень живописно смотрятся разнообразные деревья. Далее мы подошли к вольеру с гиенами. Попали в тот момент когда их кормили, и они с окровавленными мордами бегали друг за другом выхватывая добычу, а над ними... кружила стая грифов. В общем ЭКЗОТИКА, за этим мы и приехали в Гамбию. Рекомендую.",

There are hyena incases that look distressed, one of them just lying there constantly rubbing his muzzle with his forelegs. There were no staff seen at anytime except at the entrance gate. We were glad to leave.",

We had our own birdguide, Mas Sangeng, arranged by Farakunku Lodges where we were based, however there are guides available to hire at the reserve. Our guide was excellent and we would not have seen half the birds and wildlife without him. The area around the crocodile pool was a bit noisy, some boats were being taken on to the pond and this disturbed any birds there. Green Vervet Monkeys played around the benches and seemed used to visitors. It was further along the pathways we started to encounter the more interesting birds, Green and Violet Turaco, Western Bluebill and African Paradise Flycatcher to name just a few. With patience and a good guide the possibilities are endless. We had no interest in visiting the &quot;zoo&quot; preferring to spend our time looking for birds and we were not disappointed.",

      "title": "A nice walk, but not much else. . .",
      "text": "Situated on the side of the airport road to Serekunda and the beach resorts, the park is easily reached by taxi from most hotels, and is an ideal &#39;on your own&#39; half day out when you have exhausted your tour operators organized trip portfolio. The self-appointed title &#39;Nature Reserve&#39; does however raise the expectations of the first time visitor, which are unlikely to be met, hence the string of negative reviews. On arrival, first stop is the ticket hut, where you are relieved of a modest 35 Dalasi each . . . so far so good. You are then directed to an open hut where several &#39;guides&#39; are waiting. We told them we had been before and were happy to go unaccompanied; the reply is &#39;snakes sir; lots of snakes. . . if you don&#39;t know where to look, very dangerous&#39;. The guides were all wearing combat trousers tucked into high laced army boots while I was wearing M&amp;S linen shorts with a pair of Reeboks; I figured they may well have a point. In an act of extortion that The Peaky Blinders would be proud of, we were instantly relieved of a further 300D, but they had not finished yet . . . &#39;you will need binoculars&#39; they tell us, and whoosh, another 100 changes hands. What follows is in essence a very nice walk following a well worn path through shady and peaceful woodland, a few birds along the way but nothing you won&#39;t see around your hotel, an army of ants crossing the path, some epic spider&#39;s webs, but not much else. Next stop is the natural lake containing several hard to spot crocs; you are led up wooden steps to an observation platform which doubles up as a gift shop; another hard sell along the lines of &#39;the park runs on donations and what the tourists spend&#39;; we were in need of a few trinkets for nieces back home, but unfortunately the variety of gifts was on par with the variety of wildlife, and we escaped wallet intact and empty handed. Another meandering walk with more of the same; 20 years ago, the path was lined with monkeys, eager to be fed with the bananas that were sold at the entrance; no bananas this time, and no monkeys; there is now a snack stall at the enclosures, and the monkeys learned very quickly that simply hanging around here will keep them well fed with the minimum effort. They have however become very spiteful and greedy, and will quickly snatch the newly purchased bag of monkey nuts from your hand. The photo opportunities are there, if not a little predictable and staged, and short of a few hyenas in a large pen not much else here to detain you. Exit is via another walk along another path, and is a different place to your drop-off, but your taxi driver will know this and be waiting for you. A gift shop is at the exit, giving another couple of desperate women one last opportunity to mug you before you disappear forever. The guide then hints heavily that he is not paid and relies on tips; you say I have already paid 300, he says yes but I don&#39;t get that, we part with one final 200 for the guide and find our taxi. We asked our driver to stop off at Lamin Lodge on the way back for a lunch break; we then detoured back via the pharmacy for a few bits, then the mini market for a few more; all in all, a good half day away from resort, but a nice shady walk only; no more, no less. Hugely overpriced for what it is; (we spent 670D plus coke and monkey nuts); better opportunities locally to resort for both monkeys and crocs, and at a fraction of the price. Don&#39;t expect too much; don&#39;t bother with binoculars, and ditch the guide if you can.",

I only gave two stars because the forest itself is quite nice to walk around and I came with low expectations but I had the opportunity of taking a day trip from one of the beach resorts earlier in my holiday and I'm really glad I didn't",

Only a few baboons and a couple of wolves like creatures in cages and that, as they say, was that. This is a classic case of a really good bloke who had a dream once that was realized and when it was created and nurtured, it must have been fabulous. Now, it is a ghost town birdwatching place with no birds but just bumsters having taken over what was once probably something worth seeing. Don&#39;t go. There is nothing here to see. The local chancers have taken what&#39;s left of a dream over and the place is a shell. There is nothing to see. Really. Don&#39;t waste your money. Don&#39;t do it. This is a vacuum dump.",

It is said there are some cobra an python snakes as well in the area but you’ll have to be lucky.\n\nHalfway the walk there is this big tree with vultures. Loads of them sitting there.

      "text": "This is a good reserve if you are really interested in exploring the nature and go without any set expectations. There is no point going there just to tick the box on the places you visited. You need a clean, experienced and knowledgable guide with you to enjoy this park. I do not recommend taking &quot;any&quot; guide at the park as most of them are useless. Also do not go in large groups as you will scare the animals out and will only be able to see the ones in the cage. You need to have a lot of patience and stamina to walk for at least 90 minutes. The best time to visit is in the morning when the sun is not heavy on you. We went during the rainy season so it was a different experience altogether. However, the walking paths were a bit muddy and we had to be extra careful but we thoroughly enjoyed our outing. We had an excellent guide with us who was very knowledgable and knew everything about the park. He was our private guide, not costly at all. If you are visiting this country then spend a little extra it will be worth the experience you get compared to others. We saw many beautiful birds on our way as well as lots of red monkeys. They are very shy of humans so make sure you do not make any noise when you spot them. It is a treasure to see them jumping from the tree branches or just sitting over there. We spotted two chameleons and our guide said that you must be very lucky to have them. He got one of them before it ran away and put them on a stick and handed it over to us. We could see it changing colors before we let it go free in the wild and had enough of pictures with it. The experience with Hyena was great as well as this was the first time I saw them and so close. They do look dangerous but we had a Ranger protecting us while we take our picture with them having behind us in the close proximity. The Rangers will be quite supportive if you go with a known guide and that is the difference. They too will share a lot of knowledge with you. Eventually, you need to be friendly and taking interest and then everything else will automatically fall in place. Don&#39;t be like another tourist.",

It&#39;s one of the smallest parks in all of West Africa. But biodiversity is high. Along the marked trail within the park, which encompasses less than 200 hectares, you&#39;ll quickly transition from sparsely vegetated savannah into dense, verdant tropical rainforest. Thirty-meter-tall palms and mahogany trees surround you in the heart of the park, their evergreen foliage partially blocking out the bright sunlight. Abuko is a prime spot for birdwatchers. So be sure to bring your binoculars and enjoy watching the hundreds of birds flutter by. Visit the Makasutu Wildlife Trust, a research center dedicated to studying Gambia&#39;s biodiversity.",

They didn't seem to be doing very well and had very small space to move around in their cages.",

      "text": "When we first got there the guy behind the desk was so ignorant and wouldn&#39;t answer us and when he did he had such a bad attitude. Went around the park with a guide, very long walk, saw a few monkeys but he only really showed us trees and termite mounds, didn&#39;t see no birds, snakes or crocs. He took us to the baboons and explained they are in cages as they are violent... Went to see the large vulture that flew down from its perch to us, loads of other vultures flying about in the area. Went inside the hyenas den which was definitely an experience especially when they started walking towards us and wanting us to rub them like dogs and trying to play. I didn&#39;t know hyenas could be friendly!! Then on leaving the park there is a massive hippos head on display, the guide said they killed the hippo as he was eating the locals rice fields, told him it&#39;s cruel and sick for keeping the head on display, he didn&#39;t agree.... The park has potential to be better and house more animals as it did a few years back but they need to make sure animals are taken care of and I don&#39;t think tourists will appreciate seeing a rotting hippo head!! Apart from that, nice few hours out and a lot of walking.",

The cages are too small and they do not seem to have a nice and happy life. I don&#39;t think that such intelligent creatures should be held in a prison and it made me sad to see that. But if you skip the zoo part you might enjoy it, because it&#39;s a really nice place for a walk. They don&#39;t want to let you go inside without a local guide, but don&#39;t mind them, you won&#39;t get lost! If you get a guide, you need to pay for the entrance fee and also some tip to the guide - not worth it. You&#39;ll see the monkeys and lots of birds anyway :)",

They insisted we paid for a tour guide to take us through the park, the guide was very uninformative, not really talking to us or telling us about the park but simply trying to get around as quickly as possible the forcibly asking for a large tip. It would have been much nicer to simply take our time and wonder through the reserve. It was generally a pretty reserve and we did see some green vervet monkeys who were quite happy to have their photo taken but if this is what you are looking for then Bijilo park is a much better nature park with more monkeys and just as nice/nicer scenery. There were Baboons and Hyenas in cages in one section but I tend not to like seeing animals unnecessarily in cages so did not find this an enjoyable part of the park. They had also had a hippo there which had died recently and they kept its head on display (not pleasant to look at!) We had a nice day but I didn&#39;t think this park and any advantages about Bijilo ",

      "text": "As much as I wanted to visit Abuko I was almost put off by some of the things said in the negative reviews but we were booking some bird watching trips with a bird guide and he assured us it was an important place to visit. He wasn&#39;t wrong! Our very informative guide, Musa Manneh (+220) 7834098, showed us a total of 51 different species of wonderful colorful and spectacular birds that day along with an abundance of information about the various plant, insect and animal species we were seeing along our walk. Although he is predominantly a bird guide he is very knowledgeable about the natural history of Gambia and will give insights into the local culture too. It is very evident to me that the way to get the best out of this place is to arrange with someone who understands it to take you there. Avoid booking a trip with a mini bus full of people, you will disturb any wildlife as the mass of people tramp through the well trod paths of the reserve. Individual guiding is not as expensive as you might imagine in The Gambia and it pays massive dividends in how much it improves your experience of these places. You only have limited time during your holiday so why waste it by handing a poultry sum to a bumster who will walk with you but not give you any insight or understanding to the things you are seeing and not help you to see the things that prefer not to be seen! During our time there so many people walked right past us as we were standing watching some magnificent bird, once or twice people would stop to look in the direction I was pointing my camera lens and we would point out what we were seeing. A guide you have employed to take you there will ensure you avoid unwelcome advances from the bumsters and ensure you are proceeding at a pace that suits your stamina and ability, at least that is what we experienced with Musa. We set off early so we could avoid being there at the hottest time of the day. Musa also took us to explore an area of paddy fields opposite the reserve before we went in and that area was simply amazing. If anyone wished to book him before they leave home then they can do so via email musaamanneh56@yahoo.com and you can find his website by typing Musa Manneh Bird Watching Tours into your search engine. The man is a gentleman who will provide a car with a very safe driver and take great care of you, he speaks perfect English too.",

      "text": "Had a wonderful trip to Abuko. We used the &quot;tanka tanka,&quot; which means constantly switching to local taxis that travel back and forth between fixed points. Dirt cheap. A local guide is recommended. It&#39;s worth negotiating the price. Take your time, as it&#39;s also a wonderful area for hiking. Don&#39;t expect too much from the animals. You&#39;ll definitely need a guide to see them. As for potentially dangerous animals like the hungry crocodiles, I&#39;d say: you&#39;ll need one to spot them in time!",

If your putting money in a box at the lodge next to the so called croc pool that goes straight into the bumsters pocket. Regarding &#39;Eagle Heights&#39; with the Lion Cubs,Cheetahs etc (all poisoned) it was a front for a bird of prey import scam to the UK, which is well documented on Facebook.",

There are plenty of sightings of Vervet Monkeys which are well habituated to humans (they can be very amusing) and some Red Colobus Monkeys are also present. But essentially it&#39;s really just a small open air zoo. A troop of Baboons is kept in a fairly spacious enclosure, with a couple of cages Hyena nearby to the drinks stall. People tell of ongoing improvement work, but there was no sight of actual improvement on the ground since 2012, and considerable degradation since that visit. Worth a visit - I don&#39;t think so.",

However, I spoke a few days later with a different, experienced taxi driver that I have done a lot of business with, and he explained to me that many of the animals that had been there had died, which is why they had to close their doors. I am not sure what happened and I am not sure when they will be opening again but I thought I would post the information I was giving here for other people who might be planning to visit Abuko.",

They had hyenas there, vultures and a little place to get a bite to eat. Easily spend a couple of hours there. You can take a guide or go in on your own, easy to find your way around doing it alone.

My group and I (consisting of Gambians and Europeans interested in conservation and wildlife) had wanted to explore the park freely for the local wild nature. We were pressured into hiring a guide who was not overall very informative but did point out some different species, The guided then took us out a side gate to Eagle Heights, without informing us this is what was happening. He wanted us to pay another guided to show us some of the animals they have there - an experience we didn&#39;t even want. We did not pay and got walked back along the road to the entrance of the nature reserve. It could have been a very different experience.",

      "title": "Warning! Reserve Now Occupied by Unmonitored Scammer Bumsters!",
      "text": "The Abuko Nature Reserve is a large forest protected by the Government of The Gambia. It was once developed and maintained by the University of Warwick in the UK as a Darwin Field Station for biodiversity study, a project that ended in 2005. Since then, the developed portions of the Reserve have been abandoned and taken over by &quot;bumsters&quot; who know nothing about nature or biodiversity, but have figured out a number of scams to take your money. For example, the true entry fee for the park is 15 Dalasis as shown on the official receipt you are given...upon payment of 400 Dalasis!. In my case, I did not notice the receipt until I had paid the 400 Dalasis...too late sucker! Mysteriously, I was given a sticker to enter a privately owned exotic animal zoo on the highway outside of the park as a consolation. These &quot;proprietors&quot; apparently figured out an arrangement with the owners of the zoo to sell entry to that separate enterprise, off-site, under the guise that it was a mandatory fee to enter the Reserve. I was then asked for another 100 Dalasis to rent a pair of binoculars with no strap. I later found that the 10 X 50 glasses had been dropped and damaged so that the mirror prisms inside had been knocked out of alignment rendering them useless. Inasmuch as they were extremely heavy and without a strap, I simply pitched them into my sack and carried on with my own self-guided walk through the pathways of the Reserve. I respectfully declined the extremely high pressure mandatory but voluntary but mandatory requirement to hire a guide for another 300 Dalasis because I did not want to be accompanied by an unofficial &quot;guide&quot; who knew nothing about the faunna, flora and wildlife except what one could see anyway with the naked eye. The last thing I wanted was someone talking to me incessantly for the duration of my experience which did turn out to be a very beautiful 2-hour stroll through a luxurious forest full of wildlife. About halfway into the Park, I came across the remains of the Darwin Biodiversity Field Station which is adorned with old rotting posters and two bumsters dressed in disco garb and sunglasses who, not surprisingly, were requesting more &quot;donations.&quot; They presented a &quot;guestbook&quot; that was undated, but appeared to be signed by people who were donating up to 500 Dalasis for a project that unknownst to them was terminated in 2005. The donation box was not only unlocked, but it had disappeared with the slot simply allowing the money to fall on the floor. When I asked who would get the money, the &quot;boys,&quot; probably in their late 20s, stated that the money would go to &quot;the man.&quot; The station had some displays of bones that the boys had collected in the forest, lying on a table, and the remnants of old biodiversity exhibits. This field station offered no information about what was going on in the park. Notably, no one in the park, at the entrance or at this field station, could sell me a simple map of the park. For all the come-ons for money, one would have thought the easiest sell would have been a map of the park itself so that patrons like myself could find their way around the winding pathways, as obvious as they are. But then, enabled with a map, who would need a guide? This was a very simple thing to prepare and distribute for which I would have paid gladly. The absence of maps was designed to compel the purchase of a guide. Who wants foreign visitors to have a pleasant walk through the park on their own? Certainly the owners don&#39;t. Nevertheless, continuing on from the field station, I had an extremely pleasant experience noting crocodiles, many more exotic birds than I had anticipated, and plenty of monkeys. It truly is a beautiful experience if you would like to take a walk for a couple of hours on your own. At all costs, however, I would avoid the sucker plays of everyone who is offering you something for money, especially their delightful company and incessant banter while you are trying to listen to the nature and take it all in. Near end of the pathway on the interior of the park there is what appears to be a legitimate zoo which contains hyenas, baboons and wild monkeys. These animals are kept in these cages on the explanation that they were once domesticated and the proprietors are attempting to allow them to re-adapt to their natural environment. They would be released in six months. I cannot imagine who would have domesticated the hyenas that I saw in those cages. They were huge! Domesticated baboons? Finally, the exit trail leads you onto, of all place, the main highway far from your starting point. There you will find the UK owned zoo that contains some exotic animals outside of their natural habitat such as lions and cheetahs. Although I had unwittingly been forced to pay for entry into the Reserve, I passed on the idea, walked down the driveway onto the main highway, and then walked about three quarters of a kilometer down the highway to reunite with my vehicle at the entry of the park. It seemed an odd configuration to enter at one end, and then be dumped onto a main highway only to walk along noisy and fierce traffic to get back to your starting point. In the end, I did enjoy the walk and the exposure to nature that I found there. I&#39;m afraid, however, that the fact that it has been spoiled by fraudulent tricks and and parasitic squatters who have taken over a once well-maintained biodiversity project assured me that I would not return to this place. Left alone, it is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it has been spoiled by the unnatural. There are many other better maintained or unmaintained nature reserves in The Gambia that are well worth my time and money. Be warned!",

      "text": "Arrived here early afternoon. As we didn&#39;t have much time, our driver wanted to drive us to the center to see the hyenas &amp; feed the monkeys. We have been a few times in the past, many years ago &amp; had a good time, although I was never too keen on the condition the animals were kept in. We were taking friends out for a day &amp; thought it would be nice to visit. On arrival our driver asked about the price &amp; said we just wanted to drive straight into the centre. He was told its 400 d each!!!! And we had to take a guide for the walk through the forest. I understand this is the guides only mean of income but we didn&#39;t want to do the walk, we&#39;ve never had this problem before. We explained we only wanted to see the center but was told we had to do all if it so we got back in the car. The man came over &amp; said ok what will you pay for what you want to do. I said it&#39;s too late, as he was being greedy we would just go to lamin lodge for a drink. Bad luck, you lose out. Some other friends of ours did visit, on my recommendation (from past experiences) they said it was extremely overpriced, the animals were in appalling conditions &amp; overall it was rubbish. Sorry guys, had I known how badly it had gone down hill &amp; how expensive it was I would have told them not to bother. Stick to the crocodile pond at 50d each.",

A guide named Billy had excellent knowledge, I felt it a real Shame that these guides are not employed by the park which is government owned &amp; it&#39;s quite expensive compared to other tourist attractions in Gambia, so it was shocking to me that Billy only got paid the tips! There was a very wounded hyena which was a little concerned, apparently he had fought with the others. All other animals seemed happy &amp; healthy. Eagle heights is very new &amp; therefore they don&#39;t have many animals to see but the staff are very knowledgeable.",

A monkey in a cage that was paralyzed from the waist down, had to drag himself to the food, asked the keepers who lied and said it only arrived the previous day, which later was found not to be true it had been like it for over a month, I offered to pay for the vet to come out and humanly put it to sleep!!!!!!!.

Set among almost 500 acres you will be entranced by the flora and fauna around you. \n\nCurrently at the Centre are our 2 Cheetah with which we are hoping to begin a successful breeding project. A selection of Birds of Prey including a Crowned Eagle, Lanner Falcon, Tawny Eagle and Bateleur Eagle! \n\nThe current orphanage inside Abuko will be collaborating with us enabling us to move the Hyena from their current enclosure to a new and improved version. This also applies to the Baboons and any other animals that arrive at the orphanage from now on. \n\nDaily Talks will take place along with a flying demonstration. You will also be invited to take a pit stop at our Bar for an all important refreshment!\n\nFollowing the opening of the centre we will then begin our second project, Reintroduction! We will be reintroducing many once indigenous species back into the Abuko Buffer Zone. These are species that once lived there naturally but were unfortunately wiped out by humans etc.",

There are also a pair of resident nile crocodiles that inhabit the lake.. You can see many of the kingfisher species here aswell as palm nut vulture, violet turaco, hammerkop and a few hornbill species! Small fee to get in but if you have a good guide the cost of your guide normally means they pay for you! At the end of the trail at Abuko there is a woodland bar where you can get close to the vervet monkeys but don&#39;t get too close as a scratch or bite could lead to worse! By the bar is an animal orphanage of injured wild animals in recovery including baboons, Patas monkey and spotted hyena",

Мы с собой зяли нашего таксиста, чтобы он не скучал в машине, Для местных вход еще дешевле, около 15 далласи. В парке мы видели крокодила, много разных обезьян, интересные деревье. Я рекомендую, идти в парк с самого утра, так как можно встретить большее количество животных, которые после обеда прячутся. Цены на напитки в парке умеренные, можно купить арахис и бананы, чтобы покормить обезьян, но лучше взять это с собой.",

The keeper told me most of these animals have been rescued from bad homes. I was concerned about a very skinny Baboon but I was told he was taken from a soldier who was not looking after him. They certainly do their best to look after the animals. Refreshments in the center of the park with some seats in the shade, that was nice. I enjoyed the day, would recommend a visit",

In the same cage last year was a giant tortoise and a pelcan, no sign of those and seeing the conditions they lived in I fear the worse . The Hyenas were in an awful state, one was surrounded by vultures and it was obvious he was sick. Stay away if you are an animal lover or you will leave this hell hole in tears.",

      "text": "Went to Abuko Nature Reserve with good intentions, and was met by a guide that wanted 400 D for a tour (ended up with 300 D) and gave the impression it was manditory with a guide (it is not). He talked a little about the history of the park and the trees. Walked around paths with trees, bushes, a few birds, monkees and butterflies. Ended up at the orphanage with monkees and hyenas in cages. Dissapointing experience. If you go don&#39;t take a guide.",

In the beginning the quide (who invited himself with us) told that we probably aint going to see any animals.. cause they are sleeping or eating or what ever. And we really didn&#39;t see anything, not even birds. We walked for an hour in the &quot;jungle&quot;. There was a &quot;crocodile pool&quot; where was supposed to be 50 or something crocodiles, didn&#39;t see any, and nobody else has seen. Welt kind of like cheated, had to pay for the quide too. Felt bad cause of the caged animals. Aint gonna visit Abuko never again.",

      "text": "Went here on a trip out, expecting to see hundreds of varieties of birds. Saw less than 10. Paid the entrance fee, was then followed by a manager who asked for a donation for food - anything from 200 to 400D, I do not know what they spend the money on as there seems to be nothing here that they need to feed, apart from a few rescue animals (and only a few!). After a walk around, there is a visitors center - where on entering you feel instantly pressured into buying a t-shirt or other souvenirs. About half way around there is a shop, and some people selling wood carvings. You cannot sit and have a drink here without being hassled into buying a wood carving. If you buy from one seller you then get hassled by the other seller to buy from them too as they need to money to buy food!. On exiting there are a number of wood carving stalls that you have to pass. The sellers come at you from all over - one dragged me to his stall by my arm and told me that he had not had any breakfast and asked if I would buy a simple darning for &#39;only 300D&#39; so he could buy breakfast. DO NOT BUY FROM ONE OF THESE PRESSURE SELLERS OR THEY WILL ALL COME AFTER YOU FOR A SALE. On leaving the reserve, there are another two locals who will try and sell you chilled drinks for an upmarket price of D75 (they were only D20 in my hotel). Was a terrible day out, it would be a bit better if they cleared all the wood carving sellers away - or only let one or two sell - not around 10 that you have to pass on your way out, all selling the same things.",

He was able to talk passionately for the whole walk, which took a couple of hours. The animal orphanage is interesting, and you&#39;re guaranteed to see baboons, hyenas and lots and lots of vultures there - even if they are behind wire fences. Try to go if you&#39;re in the area - if only to support the business and the cause. Apparently early morning is the best time to see the animals.",

      "text": "Second visit to this lovely natural place, great for birds and walking as mentioned previously - however the small animal orphanage as it is called within this place needs financial help from what I can see. There are some Hyenas in a large cage however hidden next to the pelican is another cage with some very poorly looking Hyenas with troubles etc, I&#39;m not judging but from what I understand, this place needs some help to make sure the animals are cared for more, ie more food, medical help for animals and better quality of surroundings that they live in day after day. The baboons could do with ropes and tires hanging and things to amuse them and play with for example. As its mainly tourists that visit this place, they could increase the entrance fee which could help. I may have ideas as to how this could be improved and would love to be able to help in someway. That said, the wild monkeys are used to people and they will come and see you especially if you buy monkey nuts and will gently take them out of your hand which is a fantastic experience and one of the main reasons I visit the place.",

I've had \"guides\" describe birds as little brown jobs and others that not only correctly identify but give you Latin names as well now that's just showing off!  Ask for a try before you buy  agree a price and get them to walk with you for 10 mins  and let them show you the birds you'll soon know what you've got  You can go it alone as it is difficult to get lost just follow the path but the good guide will show you so much more than you'll see going it alone and are well worth the 400D fee for their services",

      "text": "I lived in The Gambia in the 1970s, and spent every Sunday morning walking around the nature reserve, mainly birdwatching. It is such a pleasure to return so many years later and find it almost unchanged, though sadly they need more funding to keep things going. The highlight is watching the birds from the upstairs viewing area in the large building next to the lake, which also has crocodiles. Take your binoculars and you will see so many different species! Then the walk through the forest is fascinating, so many different trees, and with luck you will see plenty of monkeys, both the Callithrix and the Red Colobus monkeys. They are easy to spot as they scamper through the trees, and trees with have fruit are often absolutely full of monkeys! Unfortunately I didn&#39;t spot a monitor lizard on this visit, though there are many large lizards in the park, and snakes too, though the reptiles are much more active during the rainy season. Halfway round the walk you reach the animal orphanage, which is a very sad sight with monkeys and baboons in enclosures, when they should be roaming wild. It&#39;s all very dilapidated and makes you feel sorry for the animals. At the end of the walk round there is a craft market, not very good I&#39;m afraid, so it&#39;s better to hurry straight through!",

      "text": "This park isn&#39;t really worth a visit. The scenery is okay, with the occasional monkey, but a group of baboons living in a much-too-small cage, one of which is kept in a kind of large crate somewhere behind the pelicans (who are also locked in a cage without water) because he&#39;s gone mad (according to one of the guides), and two groups of hyenas also forced to live in filthy surroundings without water are simply unacceptable. Don&#39;t go there, and if you love animals, don&#39;t even go near it because it&#39;s heartbreaking. I will definitely do everything in my power to get these animals out of there.",

      "text": "Abuko is a wonderfully intact piece of tropical forest, amongst the otherwise heavily populated Serrekunda area. Some reviewers seem to be under the impression this a zoo, it's not! There is a small animal orphanage at one end of the reserve but its a desperately sad place and not a reason to visit.\n\nI enjoyed wandering the narrow paths seeing birds, lizards and monkeys (you will see them if you walk slowly and quietly). The Darwin field centre is an excellent vantage point to see lots of wading birds and birds of prey as well as Nile Crocodiles.\n\nThe guides are knowledgeable and well worth taking along on an initial visit. I agree with the previous reviewer who advised taking water with you, it's quite a long way to do the full reserve circuit and the heat is sapping. The reserve doesn't get much funding so facilities are basic, but I loved it for being so quiet without lots of other people around.\n\nI would recommend Abuko more to the serious nature lover who will get more from it than someone who expects to be entertained and see an animal every 2 minutes. For me, taking time was rewarded by getting to see amazing species like the Giant Kingfisher close up. I enjoyed it so much I actually went twice during my week in The Gambia.",

The refreshment point was a bit dull, leaving us exposed to the entrances of the stallholder nearby.",

The little booklets are excellent and well worth the money.",

Book the trip with the RSPB men on Bakau beach (under white umbrella by Calypso Restaurant) if you want to enjoy spotting the birds as well as well as knowledge of the local monkeys. If not then go with the tour guides opposite the Ocean Bay Hotel. They charged us 20 quid which included the taxi & full mornings entertainment plus relaxing time sat under the African sun shades on the beautiful beach next to the park.",

However, on our way back out there were huge groups arriving. I would definitely recommend going independently with your own guide rather then with a tour company in a large group. We saw a huge variety of birds and there were certainly some very enthusiastic bird watchers there with all the high tech binoculars, telescopes, cameras etc. We also saw a couple of crocodiles and lots of monkeys. Halfway round there is an animal sanctuary where they house animals that have been removed from locals who have bought them to entertain tourists for a charge. There was a very friendly monkey that sat on my knee and played with my hair. You can buy peanuts to feed to the monkeys. We absolutely loved our time here and spent a good 3 hours wandering around spotting monkeys and birds. From what I remember it costs approx 50d (£1) each to get in.",

Within minutes we had seen a dozen or more species I&#39;d never seen before and over the three hours I was there, he was helpful, friendly and informative. He helped me see the species unique to the site which I probably would have missed without him. Admission to the reserve is very cheap but a guide will cost you about £20 upwards, depending how long you want to stay. Apart from the birds, there&#39;s a chance you might spot a croc and definitely monkeys.",

      "text": "We arrived at Abuko having heard and read quite a lot about it. It is better to come here early in the morning, not around 11am like we did since most of the animals are sheltering from the heat and crocodiles are swimming closer to the bottom of the pond. The few monkeys we saw were not scared of humans, this is because they are used to humans feeding them. People say it was great to feed wild monkeys probably haven&#39;t been to a safari or national park before. Infact you are encouraged to buy peanuts for the monekys. And the zoo in the middle is apparently kept there so tourists can at least see something in the reserve if nothing else. It is expensive to run these reserves and you can see that in the health of the hyenas and monkeys. The place was grand back in the day with lion(s) and other animals, when the founder Mr. Brewster was alive but now has deteriorated a little. The president&#39;s zoo is better funded and has more animals. Saying that, we had a lovely walk around the area and saw some birds. Since we were not bird watchers or bird lovers, we just enjoyed the different varieties without knowing what they were :-)",

      "text": "Although I thought Abuko was wonderful for the most part, (we saw a crocodile, a bushbuck and several species of monkeys and birds) I was dismayed to see the hyenas in captivity, also baboons and some other animals, all in cages. I was told that the baboons are orphaned (although it was a whole family), and also some of the other animals, but that the hyenas are just an exhibit. There also used to be a lion there but it escaped. Apparently they have links with the local zoo, and some of the animals live in captivity always. There is no need for this - visitors come to see wildlife in its natural state, not kept in a prison. The hyenas were pacing up and down ie exhibiting stereotypical behavior, which was not good to see at all. Also although there are notices up saying not to feed the wildlife however friendly it is, people (and one of the guides!) were openly feeding the monkeys peanuts, thus habituating the monkeys to humans, and causing them to lose their natural skills. Abuko should actively be fining people for doing this and the guides should be sufficiently educated so as not to do this. For this reason I have given this reserve a 3-star rating, otherwise it would be a 4 or 5.",

      "text": "It is a long walk with little of interest from the main gate to the first lodge which is twinned with the University of Warwick (Birdwatching), A bit interesting as an alligator was watching a wading bird and we watched the alligator...yawn!!... A short further walk through thicker overgrowth brings you to the heart of the reserve. Staff are always needing money to feed the animals... A very sad affair, as the main animals have allegedly been transported to the presidents old village zoo. You are left with the stench from 5 hyenas and 20 vultures who constantly watch the few monkeys that surround the area. There are a few captive monkeys to feed peanuts to if you want. Most fun was being professionally ambushed by the reserve monkeys on the way out who cleaned us of anything edible. in conclusion..It was tired, the staff were tired, the animals looked tired...",

      "text": "I loved Abuko, it has a little something for everyone. \n\nIt is quite a walk, the less mobile may want to give this a miss, but when you get to the end, the tamer monkeys are there to entertain\nand steal the nuts you have just bought for them! Keep the plastic bag out of slight or they will grab at it! \n\nIt was fantastic to feed wild monekys. This made the trip well worth it. \n\nIf you drove to the park, like I did, as a bit of advice, when you get to the cafe, go visit the hyenas and stuff, but don't go through the past with the exit sign over it. Go back the way you came, otherwise you end up a 15 minute walk down a dusty busy road from where you first started!!\n",
