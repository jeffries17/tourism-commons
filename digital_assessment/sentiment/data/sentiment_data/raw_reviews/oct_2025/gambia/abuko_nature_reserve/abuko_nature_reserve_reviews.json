We also strolled around sheep and goats, and had a great time taking pictures of animal antics. \nThis is a great piece of a trip to The Gambia",

Then they’ll try to rent you binoculars.\nOur guide was nice enough but basically it’s a long walk down a path through bushes. That’s pretty much it. If you love leaves, knock yourself out.\nThere’s a crocodile pool where you won’t see crocodiles.\nThere’s an ‘education centre’ where a man will ask for maintenance donations stood next to a couple of torn posters that haven’t been replaced in 30 years. And of course, next to all this non-learning, there is an ‘opportunity’ to buy stuff you don’t want.\nThen more walking until finally you get to the world’s most depressing zoo - where they’ll tell you some thoroughly unconvincing nonsense about why these baboons needed to be in an enclosure rather than just free. Clearly just an excuse to get tourists there and to have them buy peanuts to feed them with. Felt really sorry for them.\nAnd there’s the three pens with hyenas and vultures co-existing (emphasis on ‘existing’). \nCan’t see how anyone but the most ardent fauna and bird fan (not that we saw many of those either) could get anything out of this place. Avoid and do literally anything else.",

    "text": "Myself and my partner enjoy nature reserves and also sighting animals and so we believed that this would be the perfect place to visit.\nWe got a taxi there and the taxi driver would wait 2 hours. This was fine. It all went wrong after this! \nThe park is 35D each which is fine but then they are white tourists coming and then the coming starts! Suddenly the price was 370D and forced into having a guide and paying for the taxi driver who wasn’t even joining us! Apparently it is too “dangerous” to go without a guide. Then after this rip off we had to hire binoculars for all the birds and wildlife we will be seeing. Another 100D! So far it has cost quite a lot more than expected. First impressions seem run down so I now wasn’t expecting much and was annoyed at being ripped off. What followed was a walk with a very sweaty guide with foul body odour who spoke not very good English. What I could make out was mostly about palm trees and the English man who originally founded the park just over 40 years ago. We were taken to the crocodile pool. No crocs to be seen. Disappointing. Two birds in the distance - use the expensive binoculars. Surprise, surprise they don’t work! We were then ushered into a dreadful “gift shop” selling over priced junk and almost forced to buy something. With a very poor booklet at 450D we just gave a 200D donation to get out of the room! \nAfter this it was a boiling hot walk through a sandy path with more nonsensical waffling from the smelly guide. We saw some monkeys in trees but this was it. The walk led (after what seemed like ages) to an abysmal excuse for a zoo. Hyenas in cages with vultures and baboons in another cage. Such cruel conditions. Some monkeys roamed around wanting to be fed which resulted in another attempt to take money from us. We refused. A man was trying to sell wooden ornaments. I didn’t even bother looking at them. Was so disappointed with this place. Luckily the guide didn’t demand a tip at the end otherwise the tip would have been - this place needs shutting down. ",

Door de taxi chauffeur werd vertelt dat de overheid komend jaar ook giraffen en buffels wilde uitzetten. Hierdoor zal het “ Safari” gehalte zeker toenemen.  ",

Die Tiere waren teilweise verletzte (Rangkämpfe...) und es war allgemein eher traurig, die Tiere dort zu sehen. Einige haben auch deutliche Verhaltensstörungen gezeigt. An dieser Stelle gibt es jedoch freilebende Affen, die hier auch zutraulicher sind. Allgemein ist das ein sehr schöner Park.

Most stay still long enough for a photograph.\nAt the end is a very sad and neglected 'zoo'.\nA couple of stir crazy hyenas, an adult baboon with a couple of youngsters and some vultures.\nIn Europe this would have been closed down.\nThere is a small cafe and some very smelly toilets.",

Het was dus al 11 uur voorbij, de zon stond al hoog, dus hoge temperaturen en zeer hard licht. Ik ging om de plaatselijke vogelpracht te fotograferen, maar gezien het hete moment van de dag zag ik letterlijk 2 zwaluwstaartbijeneters, een koppeltje lelielopers en een ralreiger. \nSamengevat : mijn planning en timing was zeer knudde. Aan de vele prachtige foto's op diverse internet- natuurfora te zien is Abuko fenomenaal mooi. Ik zal het bij mijn volgende bezoek aan Gambia opnieuw proberen.",

Как только мы вошли в лес и углубились по тропинке в чащу, меня охватил животный страх. Посетителей не было, а из непроходимых, мрачных джунглей веяло холодом, жуть... Я живо представила себе, как что нибудь ужасное сейчас выскочит, выпрыгнет или не дай Бог выползет, но если поднять голову вверх светит яркое  африканское солнце и на фоне голубого неба очень живописно смотрятся разнообразные деревья. Далее мы подошли к вольеру с гиенами. Попали в тот момент когда их кормили, и они с окровавленными мордами бегали друг за другом выхватывая добычу, а над ними... кружила стая грифов. В общем ЭКЗОТИКА, за этим мы и приехали в Гамбию. Рекомендую.",

We had our own birdguide, Mas Sangeng, arranged by Farakunku Lodges where we were based, however there are guides available to hire at the reserve. Our guide was excellent and we would not have seen half the birds and wildlife without him. The area around the crocodile pool was a bit noisey, some boats were being taken on to the pond and this disturbed any birds there. Green Vervet Monkeys played around the benches and seemed used to visitors. It was further along the pathways we started to encounter the more interesting birds,  Green and Violet Turaco, Western Bluebill and African Paradise Flycatcher to name just a few.  With patience and a good guide the possibilities are endless.  We had no interest in visiting the \"zoo\" preferring to spend our time looking for birds and we were not disappointed.",

    "text": "Situated on the side of the airport road to Serekunda and the beach resorts, the park is easily reached by taxi from most hotels, and is an ideal ‘on your own’ half day out when you have exhausted your tour operators organised trip portfolio.\n\nThe self-appointed title ‘Nature Reserve’ does however raise the expectations of the first time visitor, which are unlikely to be met, hence the string of negative reviews.\nOn arrival, first stop is the ticket hut, where you are relieved of a modest 35 Dalasi each . . . so far so good. You are then directed to an open hut where several ‘guides’ are waiting. We told them we had been before and were happy to go unaccompanied; the reply is ‘snakes sir; lots of snakes . . . if you don’t know where to look, very dangerous’.\nThe guides were all wearing combat trousers tucked into high laced army boots while I was wearing M&S linen shorts with a pair of Reeboks; I figured they may well have a point.\nIn an act of extortion that The Peaky Blinders would be proud of, we were instantly relieved of a further 300D, but they had not finished yet . . . ‘you will need binoculars’ they tell us, and whoosh, another 100 changes hands.\nWhat follows is in essence a very nice walk following a well worn path through shady and peaceful woodland, a few birds along the way but nothing you won’t see around your hotel, an army of ants crossing the path, some epic spider’s webs, but not much else.\nNext stop is the natural lake containing several hard to spot crocs; you are led up wooden steps to an observation platform which doubles up as a gift shop; another hard sell along the lines of ‘the park runs on donations and what the tourists spend’;  we were in need of a few trinkets for nieces back home, but sadly the variety of gifts was on par with the variety of wildlife, and we escaped wallet intact and empty handed.\nAnother meandering walk with more of the same; 20 years ago, the path was lined with monkeys, eager to be fed with the bananas that were sold at the entrance; no bananas this time, and no monkeys; there is now a snack stall at the enclosures, and the monkeys learned very quickly that simply hanging around here will keep them well fed with the minimum effort.\nThey have however become very spiteful and greedy, and will quickly snatch the newly purchased bag of monkey nuts from your hand. The photo opportunities are there, if not a little predictable and staged, and short of a few hyenas in a large pen not much else here to detain you.\nExit is via another walk along another path, and is a different place to your drop-off, but your taxi driver will know this and be waiting for you. A gift shop is at the exit, giving another couple of desperate women one last opportunity to mug you before you disappear forever. The guide then hints heavily that he is not paid and relies on tips; you say I have already paid 300, he says yes but I don’t get that, we part with one final 200 for the guide and find our taxi.\nWe asked our driver to stop off at Lamin Lodge on the way back for a lunch break; we then detoured back via the pharmacy for a few bits, then the mini market for a few more; all in all, a good half day away from resort, but a nice shady walk only; no more, no less.\nHugely overpriced for what it is; (we spent 670D plus cokes and monkey nuts); better opportunities locally to resort for both monkeys and crocs, and at a fraction of the price.\nDon’t expect too much; don’t bother with binoculars, and ditch the guide if you can.",

The animal \"orphanage\" is really depressing and the guides let a tourist get in the enclosure with two hyenas which makes me think they have no idea how to deal with and treat animals. I only gave two stars because the forest itself is quite nice to walk around and I came with low expectations but I had the opportunity of taking a day trip from one of the beach resorts earlier in my holiday and I'm really glad I didn't",

It is said there are some cobra an python snakes as well in the area but you’ll have to be lucky.\n\nHalfway the walk there is this big tree with vultures. Loads of them sitting there.

    "text": "This is a good reserve if you are really interested in exploring the nature and go without any set expectations.  There is no point going there just to tick the box on the places you visited.  You need a proper, experienced and knowledgable guide with you to enjoy this park.  I do not recommend taking \"any\" guide at the park as most of them are useless.  Also do not go in large groups as you will scare the animals out and will only be able to see the ones in the cage.  You need to have a lot of patience and stamina to walk for at least 90 minutes.  The best time to visit is in the morning when the sun is not heavy on you.  We went during the rainy season so it was a different experience altogether.  However, the walking paths were a bit muddy and we had to be extra careful but we thoroughly enjoyed our outing.  We had an excellent guide with us who was very knowledgable and knew everything about the park.  He was our private guide, not costly at all.  If you are visiting this country then spend a little extra it will be worth the experience you get compared to others.  We saw many beautiful birds on our way as well lot of red monkeys.  They are very shy of humans so make sure you do not make any noise when you spot them.  It is a treasure to see them jumping from the tree branches or just sitting over there.  We spotted two chameleons and our guide said that you must very lucky to have them.  He got one of them before it ran away and put them on a stick and handed it over to us.  We could see it changing colors before we let it go free in the wild and had enough of pictures with it.  The experience with Hyena was great as well as this was the first time I saw them and so close.  They do look dangerous but we had a \nRanger protecting us while we take our picture with them having behind us in the close proximity.  The Rangers will be quite supportive if you go with a known guide and that is the difference.  They too will share lot of knowledge with you.  Eventually, you need to be friendly and taking interest and then everything else will automatically fall in place.  Don't be like another tourist.",

Het is één van de kleinste parken in heel West-Afrika. Maar de biodiversiteit is er hoog.\n\nOver de uitgezette route binnen het nog geen 200 hectare omvattende park loop je van dun begroeide savanne binnen mum van tijd het dichte en groene tropisch regenwoud in.\n\nDertig meter hoge palmen en mahoniebomen omringen je in het holst van het park. Hun altijd groene bladerdek beneemt je deels het felle zonlicht.\nAbuko is een plek voor vogelspotters bij uitstek. Neem dus vooral je verrekijker mee en geniet van de vele honderden vogels die je voorbij ziet fladderen.\nBreng een bezoek aan de Makasutu Wildlife Trust, een onderzoekscentrum dat zich bezighoud met studies naar Gambia's biodiversiteit.",

I didn't know hyenas could be friendly!!\n\nThen on leaving the park there is a massive hippos head on display, the guide said they killed the hippo as he was eating the locals rice fields, told him it's cruel and sick for keeping the head on display, he didn't agree....\n \nThe park has potential to be better and house more animals as it did a few years back but they need to make sure animals are taken care of and I don't think tourists will appreciate seeing a rotting hippo head!!\n\nApart from that, nice few hours out and a lot of walking.",

The cages are too small and they do not seem to have a nice and happy life. I don't think that such intelligent creatures should be held in a prison and it made me sad to see that.\n\nBut if you skip the zoo part you might enjoy it, because it's a really nice place for a walk. They don't want to let you go inside without a local guide, but don't mind them, you won't get lost! If you get a guide, you need to pay for the entrance fee and also some tip to the guide - not worth it. You'll see the monkeys and lots of birds anyway :)",

It would have been much nicer to simply take our time and wonder through the reserve.\n\nIt was generally a pretty reserve and we did see some green vervet monkeys who were quite happy to have their photo taken but if this is what you are looking for then Bijilo park is a much better nature park with more monkeys and just as nice/nicer scenery.\n\nThere were Baboons and Hyenas in cages in one section but I tend not to like seeing animals unnecessarily in cages so did not find this an enjoyable part of the park. They had also had a hippo there which had died recently and they kept its head on display (not pleasant to look at!)   \n\nWe had a nice day but I didn't think this park and any advantages over Bijilo ",

We zagen de hyena's in een grote ren achter een dubbele laag kippengaas. In een andere ren zaten een paar apen ,een jong hert, een schildpad en een gier. Diverse apen konden zich wel vrij bewegen. We waren niet gecharmeerd van deze plek. Nu ik de geplaatste foto 's bekijk denk ik dat onze gids ons veel niet heeft laten zien.",

    "text": "As much as I wanted to visit Abuko I was almost put off by some of the things said in the negative reviews but we were booking some bird watching trips with a bird guide and he assured us it was an important place to visit. He was not wrong! \nOur very informative guide, Musa Manneh (+220) 7834098, showed us a total of 51 different species of wonderful colourful and spectacular birds that day along with an abundance of information about the various plant, insect and animal species we were seeing along our walk. Although he predominantly a bird guide he is very knowledgeable about the natural history of Gambia and will give insights into the local culture too. \nIt is very evident to me that the way to get the best out of this place is to arrange with someone who understands it to take you there. Avoid booking a trip with a mini bus full of people, you will disturb any wildlife as the mass of people tramp through the well trod paths of the reserve. Individual guiding is not as expensive as you might imagine in The Gambia and it pays massive dividends in how much it improves your experience of these places. You only have limited time during your holiday so why waste it by handing a poultry sum to a bumster who will walk with you but not give you any insight or understanding to the things you are seeing and not help you to see the things that prefer not to be seen! \nDuring our time there so many people walked right past us as we were standing watching some magnificent bird, once or twice people would stop to look in the direction I was pointing my camera lens and we would point out what we were seeing. \nA guide you have employed to take you there will ensure you avoid unwelcome advances from the bumsters and ensure you are proceeding at a pace that suits your stamina and ability, at least that is what we experienced with Musa. \nWe set off early so we could avoid being there at the hottest time of the day. Musa also took us to explore an area of paddy fields opposite the reserve before we went in and that area was simply amazing. If anyone wished to book him before they leave home then they can do so via email musaamanneh56@yahoo.com and you can find his website by typing Musa Manneh Bird Watching Tours into your search engine. The man is a gentleman who will provide a car with a very safe driver and take great care of you, he speaks perfect English too.",

Een lokale gids is wel een aanrader. Even onderhandelen over de prijs is zinvol. Neem er de tijd voor, want het is ook een heerlijk wandelgebied. Stel je niet te veel voor van de diersoorten.

There are plenty of sightings of Vervet Monkeys which are well habituated to humans (they can be very amusing)  and some Red Colobus Monkeys are also present.  \n\nBut essentially it’s really just a small open air zoo.  A troop of Baboons is kept in a fairly spacious enclosure,  with a couple of cages Hyena nearby to the drinks stall.\nPeople tell of ongoing improvement work,  but there was no sight of actual improvement on the ground since 2012,  and considerable degradation since that visit.\n\nWorth a visit  -  I don’t think so.",

Er zit geen wild, of je moet de opgesloten bavianen, de gier ende hyena's als wild zien. Deze dieren zitten in veel te kleine kooien opgesloten. Het is dieronvriendelijk. In de vijver zou ook nog een verdwaalde krokodil moeten zitten, maar die hebben we niet gezien.\nAls je Abuko niet zou bezoeken, dan mis je niets.",

    "text": "The Abuko Nature Reserve is a large forest protected by the Government of The Gambia. It was once developed and maintained by the University of Warwick in the UK as a Darwin Field Station for biodiversity study, a project that ended in 2005. Since then, the developed portions of the Reserve have been abandoned and taken over by \"bumsters\" who know nothing about nature or biodiversity, but have figured out a number of scams to take your money. \n\nFor example, the true entry fee for the park is 15 Dalasis as shown on the official receipt you are given...upon payment of 400 Dalasis!. In my case, I did not notice the receipt until I had paid the 400 Dalasis...too late sucker! Mysteriously, I was given a sticker to enter a privately owned exotic animal zoo on the highway outside of the park as a consolation. These \"proprietors\" apparently figured out an arrangement with the owners of the zoo to sell entry to that separate enterprise, off-site, under the guise that it was a mandatory fee to enter the Reserve. I was then asked for another 100 Dalasis to rent a pair of binoculars with no strap. I later found that the 10 X 50 glasses had been dropped and damaged so that the mirror prisms inside had been knocked out of alignment rendering them useless. Inasmuch as they were extremely heavy and without a strap, I simply pitched them into my sack and carried on with my own self-guided walk through the pathways of the Reserve. \n\nI respectfully declined the extremely high pressure mandatory but voluntary but mandatory requirement to hire a guide for another 300 Dalasis because I did not want to be accompanied by an unofficial \"guide\" who knew nothing about the faunna, flora and wildlife except what one could see anyway with the naked eye. The last thing I wanted was someone talking to me incessantly for the duration of my experience which did turn out to be a very beautiful 2-hour stroll through a luxurant forest full of wildlife. \n\nAbout halfway into the Park, I came across the remains of the Darwin Biodiversity Field Station which is adorned with old rotting posters and two bumsters dressed in disco garb and sunglasses who, not surprisingly, were requesting more \"donations.\" They presented a \"guestbook\" that was undated, but appeared to be signed by people who were donating up to 500 Dalasis for a project that unbeknownst to them was terminated in 2005. The donation box was not only unlocked, but it had disappeared with the slot simply allowing the money to fall on the floor. When I asked who would get the money, the \"boys,\" probably in their late 20s,  stated that the money would go to \"the man.\" The station had some displays of bones that the boys had collected in the forest, lying on a table, and the remnants of old biodiversity exhibits. This field station offered no information about what was going on in the park. \n\nNotably, no one in the park, at the entrance or at this field station, could sell me a simple map of the park. For all the come-ons for money, one would have thought the easiest sell would have been a map of the park itself so that patrons like myself could find their way around the winding pathways, as obvious as they are. But then, enabled with a map, who would need a guide? This was a very simple thing to prepare and distribute for which I would have paid gladly. The absence of maps ws designed to compel the purchase of a guide. Who wants foreign visitors to have a pleasant walk through the park on their own? Certainly the proprietors do not. \n\nNevertheless, continuing on from the field station, I had an extremely pleasant experience noting crocodiles, many more exotic birds than I had anticipated, and plenty of monkeys. It truly is a beautiful experience if you would like to take a walk for a couple of hours on your own. At all costs, however, I would avoid the sucker plays of everyone who is offering you something for money, especially their delightful company and incessant banter while you are trying to listen to the nature and take it all in. \n\nNear end of the pathway on the interior of the park there is what appears to be a legitimate zoo which contains hyenas, baboons and wild monkeys. These animals are kept in these cages on the explanation that they were once domesticated and the proprietors are attempting to allow them to re-adapt to their natural environment. They would be released in six months. I cannot imagine who would have domesticated the hyenas that I saw in those cages. They were huge! Domesticated baboons? Finally, the exit trail leads you onto, of all place,  the main highway far from your starting point. There you will find the UK owned zoo that contains some exotic animals outside of their natural habitat such as lions and cheetahs. Although I had unwittingly been forced to pay for entry into the Reserve, I passed on the idea, walked down the driveway onto the main highway, and then walked about three quarters of a kilometer down the highway to reunite with my vehicle at the entry of the park. It seemed an odd configuration to enter at one end, and then be dumped onto a main highway only to walk along noisy and fierce traffic to get back to your starting point. \n\nIn the end, I did enjoy the walk and the exposure to nature that I found there. I'm afraid, however, that the fact that it has been spoiled by fraudulent tricks and and parasitic squatters who have taken over a once well-maintained biodiversity project assured me that I would not return to this place. Left alone, it is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it is been spoiled by the unnatural. There are many other better maintained or unmaintained nature reserves in The Gambia that are well worth my time and money. Be forewarned!",

We have been a few times in the past, many years ago & had a good time, although I was never too keen on the condition the animals were kept in. We were taking friends out for a day & thought it would be nice to visit. \n\nOn arrival our driver enquired about the price & said we just wanted to drive straight into the centre. He was told its 400 d each!!!! And we had to take a guide for the walk through the forest. I understand this is the guides only mean of income but we didn't want to do the walk, we've never had this problem before. We explained we only wanted to see the centre but was told we had to do all if it so we got back in the car. The man came over & said ok what will you pay for what you want to do. I said it's too late, as he was being greedy we would just go to lamin lodge for a drink. Bad luck, you lost out. \n\nSome other friends of ours did visit, on my recommendation (from past experiences) they said it was extremely overpriced, the animals were in appalling conditions & overall it was rubbish. Sorry guys, had I known how badly it had gone down hill & how expensive it was I would have told them not to bother. \n\nStick to the crocodile pond at 50d each.",

There was a very wounded hyena which was a little concerning, apparently he had fought with the others. All other animals seemed happy & healthy. Eagle heights is very new & therefore they don't have many animals to see but the staff are very knowledgeable.",

A monkey in a cage that was paralysed from the waist down, had to drag himself to the food, questioned the keepers who lied and said it only arrived the previous day, which later was found not to be true it had been like it for over a month, I offered to pay for the vet to come out and humanly put it to sleep!!!!!!!.

Set among almost 500 acres you will be entranced by the flora and fauna around you. \n\nCurrently at the Centre are our 2 Cheetah with which we are hoping to begin a successful breeding project. A selection of Birds of Prey including a Crowned Eagle, Lanner Falcon, Tawny Eagle and Bateleur Eagle! \n\nThe current orphanage inside Abuko will be collaborating with us enabling us to move the Hyena from their current enclosure to a new and improved version. This also applies to the Baboons and any other animals that arrive at the orphanage from now on. \n\nDaily Talks will take place along with a flying demonstration. You will also be invited to take a pit stop at our Bar for an all important refreshment!\n\nFollowing the opening of the centre we will then begin our second project, Reintroduction! We will be reintroducing many once indigenous species back into the Abuko Buffer Zone. These are species that once lived there naturally but were unfortunately wiped out by humans etc.",

There are also a pair of resident nile crocodiles that inhabit the lake.. You can see many of the kingfisher species here aswell as palm nut vulture, violet turaco, hammerkop and a few hornbill species! Small fee to get in but if you have a good guide the cost of your guide normally means they pay for you! At the end of the trail at Abuko there is a woodland bar where you can get close to the vervet monkeys but don't get too close as a scratch or bite could lead to worse! By the bar is an animal orphanage of injured wild animals in recovery including baboons, Patas monkey and spotted hyena",

Мы с собой зяли нашего таксиста, чтобы он не скучал в машине, Для местных вход еще дешевле, около 15 далласи. В парке мы видели крокодила, много разных обезьян, интересные деревье. Я рекомендую, идти в парк с самого утра, так как можно встретить большее количество животных, которые после обеда прячутся. Цены на напитки в парке умеренные, можно купить арахис и бананы, чтобы покормить обезьян, но лучше взять это с собой.",

They have Hyenas who are to fat to even chase the vultures away from pinching their food, never seen such fat animals. Also caged  baboons. The keeper told me most of these animals have been rescued from bad homes. I was concerned about a very skinny Baboon but I was told he was taken from a soldier who was not looking after him. They certainly do their best to look after the animals. Refreshments in the centre of the park with some seats in the shade, that was nice. I enjoyed the day, would recommend a visit",

Apart from the two types of monkey that were roaming about (one type was the same as the ones that come to the hotel) the others were caged, the hyenas were just lying about because of the heat, the crocodiles were nowhere to be seen, and i saw one exotic looking bird (apart from the caged parrot)!\nThey said they were getting more animals in soon but it wasn't a very exciting walk unfortunately, but to be fair its not their fault that the animals were hiding, not around and tired.",

The baboon troop has dwindled from 40 animals to a handful,there kept in a bare cage,in another sparse cage was a vulture with a live monkey for company it was obviously the birds food! In the same cage last year was a giant tortoise and a pelcan,no sign of those and seeing the conditions they living in I fear the worse . The Hyenas were in a awful state ,one was surounded by vultures and it was obvious he was sick. Stay away if you are an animal lover or you will leave this hell hole  in tears.",

And we really did not see anything, not even birds. We walked an hour in the \"jungle\". There was a \"crocodile pool\" where was supposed to be 50 or something crocodiles, didnt see any, and nobody else has seen.\n\nWelt kind of like cheated, had to pay for the quide too.

Paid the entrance fee, was then followed by a manager who asked for a donation for food - anything from 200 to 400D, I do not know what they spend the money on as there seems to be nothing here that they need to feed, apart from a few rescue animals (and only a few!). After a walk around, there is a visitors centre - where on entering you feel instantly pressured into buying a t-shirt or other souvenirs. About half way around there is a shop, and some people selling wood carvings. You cannot sit and have a drink here without being hassled into buying a wood carving. If you buy from one seller you then get hassled by the other seller to buy from them too as they need to money to buy food!. On exiting there are a number of wood carving stalls that you have to pass. The sellers come at you from all over - one dragged me to his stall by my arm and told me that he had not had any breakfast and asked if I would buy a simple darning for 'only 300D' so he could buy breakfast. DO NOT BUY FROM ONE OF THESE PRESSURE SELLERS OR THEY WILL ALL COME AFTER YOU FOR A SALE. On leaving the reserve, there are another two locals who will try and sell you chilled drinks for an upmarket price of D75 (they were only D20 in my hotel). Was a terrible day out, it would be a bit better if they cleared all the wood carving sellers away - or only let one or two sell - not around 10 that you have to pass on your way out, all selling the same things.",

De andere dieren (Bavianen, hyena's, een zelfdzame gier, schildpadden) zaten in veel te kleine kooien, en daarvoor kan je bij ons ook in de Zoo terecht. Ingang: 30 dalasi (=0,60EUR). Bijkomend minpunt: aan de ingang liep een man die vroeg voor donaties voor het park, maar zelfs onze lokale gids heeft ons dit afgeraden omdat je niet weet waar je geld terecht komt...",

Hay Yenas, pájaros, buitres...\nJusto delante del African zoo está Jungle Man, te ofrecerá refrescos bien fríos, y podrás disfrutar de un buen rato charlando con él, y disfrutando del exótico lugar tomando un refresco. Le encanta poner las banderitas que le traen los clientes y te dará una agradable conversación.\nOjo si es época de lluvias! Ponte antimosquito porque te parecerá estar en la selva!",

He was able to talk passionately for the whole walk, which took a couple of hours. \n\nThe animal orphanage is interesting, and you're guaranteed to see baboons, hyenas and lots and lots of vultures there - even if they are behind wire fences. \n\nTry to go if you're in the area - if only to support the business and the cause.

    "text": "Second visit to this lovely natural place, great for birds and walking as mentioned previously - however the small animal orphanage as it is called within this place needs financial help from what I can see.  There are some Hyena's in a large cage however hidden next to the pelican is another cage with some very poorly looking Hyenas with sores etc, I'm not judging but from what I understand, this place needs some help to make sure the animals are cared for more, ie more food, medical help for animals and better quality of surroundings that they live in day after day.  The baboons could do with ropes and tyres hanging and things to amuse them and play with for example.  As its mainly tourists that visit this place, they could increase the entrance fee which could help. I have may ideas as to how this could be improved and would love to be able to help in someway.  That said, the wild monkeys are used to people and they will come and see you especially if you buy monkey nuts and will gently take them out of you hand which is a fantastic experience and one of the main reasons i viisit the place.",

I've had \"guides\" describe birds as little brown jobs and others that not only correctly identify but give you Latin names as well now that's just showing off!  Ask for a try before you buy  agree a price and get them to walk with you for 10 mins  and let them show you the birds you'll soon know what you've got  You can go it alone as it is difficult to get lost just follow the path but the good guide will show you so much more than you'll see going it alone and are well worth the 400D fee for their services",

If you are not don't think they are freebies and say no.\nAfter paying the fee and entering the park another man comes up with a donation form for maintenance on the park. They should include that in the ticket price and don't hassle on every opportunity.\n\nWe spotted some beautiful trees and we came across some monkeys. (we dont have the expert eye for birds so we didnt notice them) Also some termite hills.\nSomewhere halfway there were some animals caged up. Baboons, 2 pelicans, a turtle and some hyena's.\nThe smaller monkeys run around and you can buy a bag of peanuts there to feed them. (about 25D for a bag) The bigger ones come pick them out of your hand and they can be quite greedy so you have to throw some around for the smaller ones to also enjoy some.\n\nMore walking ahead you come through a souvenir area.\n\nThis trip is for you if you like to walk a small hour and like to see some nature and animals.\n\nAfterwards we also stopped at the nearby goat and sheep market.",

It is such a pleasure to return so many years later and find it almost unchanged, though sadly they need more funding to keep things going.  The highlight is watching the birds from the upstairs viewing area in the large building next to the lake, which also has crocodiles.  Take your binoculars and you will see so many different species!  Then the walk through the forest is fascinating, so many different trees, and with luck you will see plenty of monkeys, both the Callithrix and the Red Colobus monkeys.  They are easy to spot as they scamper through the trees, and trees with have fruit are often absolutely full of monkeys!  Unfortunately I didnt spot a monitor lizard on this visit, though there are many large lizards in the park, and snakes too, though the reptiles are much more active during the rainy season.  Halfway round the walk you reach the animal orphanage, which is a very sad sight with monkeys and baboons in enclosures, when they should be roaming wild.  Its all very dilapidated and makes you feel sorry for the animals.  At the end of the walk round there is a craft market, not very good I'm afraid, so it's better to hurry straight through!",

There is a small animal orphanage at one end of the reserve but its a desperately sad place and not a reason to visit.\n\nI enjoyed wandering the narrow paths seeing birds, lizards and monkeys (you will see them if you walk slowly and quietly). The Darwin field centre is an excellent vantage point to see lots of wading birds and birds of prey as well as Nile Crocodiles.\n\nThe guides are knowledgeable and well worth taking along on an initial visit. I agree with the previous reviewer who advised taking water with you, it's quite a long way to do the full reserve circuit and the heat is sapping. The reserve doesn't get much funding so facilities are basic, but I loved it for being so quiet without lots of other people around.\n\nI would recommend Abuko more to the serious nature lover who will get more from it than someone who expects to be entertained and see an animal every 2 minutes. For me, taking time was rewarded by getting to see amazing species like the Giant Kingfisher close up. I enjoyed it so much I actually went twice during my week in The Gambia.",

The trip was cancelled so I followed advise from TripAdviser and had the most wonderful time using a local professional guide. I also discovered The University of Warwick (probably LifeSciences) have been working at Abuku for some years as part of a research programme. The little booklets are excellent and well worth the money.",

    "text": "we visited abuku in january with our 7 year old son, he loved it once we had actually found where the animals were, they keep the animals quite far from the entrance to the park, we declined the guide and walked a massive circle for nearly an hour to arrive back at the entrance having found nothing, we got our directions then took another 20 minute walk into the bush (get the guide at the entrance its worth it) we eventually came to 2 large enclosures one with lots of baboons going wild for the nuts we had purchased to feed them and another breed of monkey in the other and green monkeys all around us roaming free with the escapee (a baby baboon that refused to go back into the enclosure) i think there was around 5 different species of monkey/baboons in total as well as a monitor lizard we had passed on the way in.. after our talk from the keeper she guided us over to the final enclosure where the hyenas were having an afternoon nap, they were huge and there was also vultures in the enclosure, my boy was mesmerised,....... after a rest stop at the tuck shop for ice cold drinks we haggled ourselves a nice bargain on a wood carved ornament and headed our way to the exit... all in all was a very memorable day and so glad we went however it is not very interesting until the final moments of the park when u reach the animals.... am i glad i went? yes definitely and would recommend it too, but only once! so will i be returning? in a word,,, no.",

So many monkeys!  Book the trip with the RSPB men on Bakau beach (under white umbrella by Calypso Restaurant) if you want to enjoy spotting the birds as well as well as knowledge of the local monkeys. If not then go with the tour guides opposite the Ocean Bay Hotel. They charged us 20 quid which included the taxi & full mornings entertainment plus relaxing time sat under the African sun shades on the beautiful beach next to the park.",

However, on our way back out there were huge groups arriving. I would definately recommend going independantly with your own guide rather then with a tour company in a large group. We saw a huge variety of birds and ther were certainly some very enthusiastic bird watchers there with all the high tech binoculars, telescopes, cameras etc. We also saw a couple of crocodiles and lots of monkeys. Halfway round there is an animal sanctuary where they house animals that have been removed from locals who have bought them to entertain tourists for a charge. There was a very friendly monkey that sat on my knee and played with my hair. You can buy peanuts to feed to the monkeys. We absolutely loved our time here and spent a good 3 hours wandering around spotting monkeys and birds. From what I remember it cost approx 50d (£1) each to get in.",

It is better to come here early in the morning, not around 11am like we did since most of the animals are sheltering from the heat and crocodiles are swimming closer to the bottom of the pond.\n\nThe few monkeys we saw were not scared of humans, this is because they are used to humans feeding them. People saying it was great to feed wild monkeys probably have not been to a safari or national park before. Infact you are encouraged to buy peanuts for the monekys. And the zoo in the middle is apparently kept there so tourists can atleast see something in the reserve if nothing else. It is expensive to run these reserves and you can see that in the health of the hyenas and monkeys. The place was grand back in the day with lion(s) and other animals, when the founder Mr.Brewster was alive but now has deteriorated a little. The president's zoo is better funded and has more animals.\n\nSaying that, we had a lovely walk around the area and saw some birds. Since we were not bird watchers or bird lovers, we just enjoyed the different varieties without knowing what they were :-)",

    "text": "Although I thought Abuko was wonderful for the most part, (we saw a crocodile, a bushbuck and several species of monkeys and birds) I was dismayed to see the hyenas in captivity, also baboons and some other animals, all in cages. I was told that the baboons are orphaned (though it was a whole family), and also some of the other animals, but that the hyenas are just an exhibit. There also used to be a lion there but it escaped. Apparently they have links with the local zoo, and some of the animals live in captivity always. There is no need for this - visitors come to see wildlife in its natural state, not kept in a prison. The hyenas were pacing up and down i.e. exhibiting stereotypical behaviour, which was not good to see at all.\n\nAlso although there are notices up saying not to feed the wildlife however friendly it is, people (and one of the guides!) were openly feeding the monkeys peanuts, thus habituating the monkeys to humans, and causing them to lose their natural skills. Abuko should actively be fining people for doing this and the guides should be sufficiently educated so as not to do this. \n\nFor this reason I have given this reserve a 3-star rating, otherwise it would be a 4 or 5.",
