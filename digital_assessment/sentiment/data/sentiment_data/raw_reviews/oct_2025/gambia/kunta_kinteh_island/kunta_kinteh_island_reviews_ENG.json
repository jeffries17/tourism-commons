As another review said - I do wish they would keep up with it more if possible, as it's likely to be gone one day in the not-so-distant future due to decay (per our guide, even). Overall, definitely worth the stop and knowledge gained.",

      "text": "We visited this with our local driver and guide, Muhammed Camara (also known as Big Mo). Mo arrived at our hotel at the agreed-upon time, drove us to the ferry, and arranged our ferry tickets. He also always has cold drinks (water and soft drinks) for you, which was very helpful considering the temperatures. Upon arrival, a car and driver were waiting, and we first visited the historic village of Juffurey, famous for its connection to the slave trade. Mo had arranged a guide there who could tell us all about it during our visit to the museum. Afterward, Mo arranged a boat with a guide to cross to Kunta Kinthe Island. It&#39;s bizarre when you think about what happened there; the people who were locked up couldn&#39;t possibly escape, as it&#39;s located in the middle of the Gambia River. At the end of the trip, Mo arranged lunch there, and then we headed back to the ferry. An interesting day trip, and the added value of our guide speaks for itself... everything was perfectly organized. And he was able to take some beautiful photos of us again. Big Mo is highly recommended if you&#39;re looking for a reliable, English-speaking guide who&#39;s easy to work with and arranges everything perfectly for you. +220-703 15 53",

You will probably not hang around the island more than 15 minutes.  The area was beautiful.    I believe it's worth a visit.",

      "text": "My visit to Kunta Kinteh Island was excellent. I&#39;ve visited a few slave trade sites in West Africa, but this one was different. I was the only tourist there and, although it was dilapidated, it felt very authentic. There are a few points of information throughout the island that provide some background and it&#39;s quite impactful to walk around the small island itself. I would recommend a guide / driver as there are a few steps to the journey of getting there, especially from the Serrekunda area. Once we arrived, a local guide took the boat with us and escorted me around the island. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. I had read that the island is being impacted by climate change, and the local guide said that efforts are being made to restrict any impact. I hope that these efforts are a priority as this island should definitely be preserved. There is a museum on the mainland which is informative, but I believe that a fee is required to take photos. I would recommend a visit to Kunte Kinteh Island to anyone visiting Gambia. I learned a lot there and really appreciated the knowledge from my guide and the museum.",

      "title": "Roots Tour with Armstrong Tours",
      "text": "My friends and I booked the Roots day trip to Kunta Kinteh Island with Armstrong Tours, who were based opposite the New Wild Monkey Bar on Serrakunda in Kololi. The trip was excellent, but what made it stand out from the trips that we booked through our hotel was Armstrong Tours, their lovely drivers and our guide for the day; Abdoulie. The trip was cheaper, the group smaller (we didn&#39;t lose an hour picking up from various other hotels) and the transport was in a mix of pick-up trucks and jeeps, as well as the ferry to the North and the small boat to the island. We had a much more authentic journey than that we would have experienced in an air-conditioned coach! The journey from Kololi to Kunta Kinteh is a long one, but well worth it to learn more about the appalling trade in human lives that was carried out. Abdoulie sat in the back of the jeep with us en-route to the small museum and told us stories about life in Gambia, before passing over to another guide at the museum (I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve forgotten his name) who also took us over to Kunta Kinteh island, who was passionate about passing on the information about the trans-Atlantic slave trade, much of which originated from this point, and ensuring that what happened is never forgotten. On the return journey we stopped at a small village to distribute notebooks and pencils purchased on the way out. It seems like a minor thing but Abdoulie assured us that having grown up in that area he knows how important and appreciated these items are. They stop at a different village each week so that everyone gets the chance to receive these books and pencils. Before boarding the ferry back to the South we returned to the local restaurant where we&#39;d had breakfast and had a traditional Gambian dish of chicken yassa which was absolutely delicious. Any trip to the Gambia should include this historical Roots Tour, which most of the tour agencies carry out, but please think about supporting a local business before booking all your tours through your hotel or your travel agency, as not only are all the proceeds then going towards a small local business, but you will also receive a much more authentic, interesting, personal experience.

      "text": "The experience as a whole is definitely one that everyone should take time to participate in, but be warned that an entire day should be set aside for this adventure. Depending on where you start out, this trip can be very time-consuming, especially if you&#39;re on the southern bank and have to use the ferry to cross from Banjul to Barra. The ferry is inconsistent and isn&#39;t in the best of shape. Regardless the island itself is slowly deteriorating and the locals try their best to make it an enjoyable experience. The island itself can be seen in roughly ten minutes but I&#39;ve found that the guide often makes the experience better depending on how much they actually know about the island&#39;s history. This is typically followed by a tour of a slave trade museum which is housed in an old British warehouse. The museum is informative but could use some better upkeep. Entry to it is free, but if you desire to take photos then you&#39;ll have to pay 100 Gambian Dalasi. Overall I think it&#39;s a great experience and adventure to have, but I think it&#39;s a one-and-done kind of trip.",

The guide tells us the history of slavery in English (Bamba is there to translate into French). Then comes the visit to the museum (an emotional sequence for me 😪) And finally, the meeting with the 8th generation of Kunta Kinteh. This is the 4th time we have come to Gambia, we have made a number of visits. Bamba is now a friend, he has been practicing this profession with passion for several years and is very professional, we recommend him without hesitation.

Famara was very enthusiastic about his trips and had a lot to say about them. This made us enthusiastic too and we decided to go on more trips with Famara. First, we went with Famara to Galloya Village, the Snake Farm, and Paradise Beach. Famara also took lots of photos, so we have many memories. Along the way, Famara was able to tell us a lot about the places we visited, as well as the places we passed. You can also ask Famara anything; he&#39;s very knowledgeable about almost everything, which allows you to get to know Gambia very quickly. Famara was also interested in us and in Dutch culture, which allowed us to have many enjoyable conversations. Our second trip was to Monkey Park. Here too, Famara had a lot to say and let us enjoy the peace and quiet. Afterward, Famara invited us to his home, which was also very special to see. Our last trip was to Kunta Kinteh. We learned a great deal there too. Famara is not only incredibly knowledgeable about various subjects, but he also has a great sense of humor, making it a pleasure to take tours with him. He&#39;s a genuine person who will do everything he can to ensure his guests have the experience they desire. You can always contact Famara Marong at +220 744 1152, especially if you really want to enjoy your vacation and see everything!",

      "text": "This is an interesting and important place to visit on a trip to Gambia. However, a word of warning, the journey to get there is long (took us 10 hours there and back through there was a problem with the ferry so might be 8 on a good day). We went with a guide to make things easier, though you could figure it out yourself if you wanted. We were staying on the coast in the beach resorts (Kololi/Senegambia). First you drive to Banjul. Then get the ferry to Barra (not very regular, maybe 1 every 1.5 hours, takes about 30 minutes to cross). Then another taxi to the museum (this leg will be easier soon as they&#39;re halfway through tarmacing the road). Then a pirogue boat to the island where a guide (with not great English) will show you around for about 30/40 minutes. Then you visit the small museum about the slave trade, which is interesting but a bit basic, again 30/40 minutes. The guide charged us £80 for the day for 2 people (including lunch and water) and then we had to pay another £33 for the museum/island/pirogue. Then tips for all the guides and drivers. I expect we were overcharged and while it&#39;s a good place to visit, and the ferry and pirogue were also good experiences, I don&#39;t think it was worth it in terms of the cost and time traveling.",

      "text": "A very long and boring boat tour sold by FTI; the total time on the river was over 8 hours. The boat was very dilapidated and lacked a mid-engine. Instead, a 40 hp outboard motor was installed aft. At some point, you reach a place where Kunta Kinthe was born?! Here, you learn about the enslavement of Africans and their shipping to America. After a walk to a neighboring settlement, you meet Kunta Kinthe&#39;s great-great-great-grandmother. A few words about his life, and they pass around various papers, including a poor photocopy of a postcard (€5) and a &quot;document&quot; (€5) where you can write down that you visited Kunta Kinthe. It&#39;s all about making money; you can &quot;voluntarily donate&quot; for the lecture, and anyone with sweets can leave them there. Whether a different woman will be there the next day – you never know! Oh, and the island, here are the remains of a fortress. Access to the island requires acrobatic skills, depending on the tide; you have to climb more than half a meter at a time! After a brief explanation, you&#39;re allowed to take a few photos, but time is running out... We didn&#39;t arrive back in Banjul until after 7:00 p.m. For history buffs, take a taxi; they do the tour in half a day! For example, Gitteh Tours, the driver, Malang Lou, speaks German; you can book him in English via WhatsApp (002207836292).",

      "text": "We do not leave this visit unscathed, the journey is quite long on unpaved roads (about 3/4 hour from the ferry), you will pass through small villages (if you can, bring small gifts for the children, pens, pencils, notebooks, stuffed animals, etc.). We go to the island by canoe (about 10 minutes) we descend into the canoe by a ladder (well maintained by the locals). English guide who relates slavery not without emotion. There is near the landing stage a small restaurant run by a Dutch lady, the food is very good there. On leaving you can go to the mission where there is a small museum on slavery which is worth the detour. There is also an establishment which helps children.",
