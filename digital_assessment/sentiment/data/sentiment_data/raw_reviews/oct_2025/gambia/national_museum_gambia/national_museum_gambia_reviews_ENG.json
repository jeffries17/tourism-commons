      "text": "This well-worn museum carries many gems of the history, archeology, and music of The Gambia. The artifacts cover from the Stone Age to the present with photographs, pottery, and displays. I really enjoyed seeing the musical instruments of the various groups. These precious, valuable historical items are not well-protected and exposed to air and people touching them,  The items merit a financial investment to upgrade how the items are conserved.\nVery interesting museum with sculpture park in front with 5 sculptures and a mural.\nRestroom is in another building, not wheel chair accessible.",

      "text": "One of my favourite things to do when travelling around the world is going to the musea where countries tell something about their national history. The National Museum of the Gambia is not like the Louvre, Uffizi of the Hermitage, but it shows on its own way a story of national struggle, pride and hope. In a way, walking around here learned me more then a guided tour in the Grand Gallery. Ask your tour guide or hotel if they could drop you off here and spend a moment of your time to look around a d have a chat with the people working here, they love to tell you more about the history of the Gambia. Don't forget to leave a tip, as they will use it for the maintenance of the museum.",

The museum is dated and many of the displays are exposed to open windows and dirty. You are warned not to touch anything and if you want to take a photo there is an extra $2 US charge. Some of the exhibits are interesting and are not seen in other museums we visited in Africa. I found the costumes particularly interesting. At a leisurely pace expect to spend about 30 minutes in the museum. There is access to a toilet just outside the entrance.",

Perhaps that&#39;s precisely why the images and objects on display, at least for me, have a more powerful and impressive impact than a visit to a modern and sophisticated Western museum. Here, with respect for the history of the country and its people, and with modest resources, a place has been created that uniquely illuminates the harsh aspects of life in an African country (then and now). The attentive visitor may need a moment to absorb it, but they will undoubtedly be touched. The initiative for such a museum deserves high praise. Definitely worth a visit!",
