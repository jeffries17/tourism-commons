Even the ferry ride from Banjul was an experience. A glimpse into the &quot;real&quot; Africa. Everything was well organized. The fort is more worth seeing than it seems at first glance. A local guide explains the details. Highly recommended +++",

      "text": "I visited Barra on a whim, not particularly for the fort, but for the ferry ride there and back. I approached the fort, not really thinking much of it and thinking I would have a peak then turn around. However, was amazingly welcomed by Ebrahim when I arrived. He gave an outstanding tour of the museum and fort. It was amazing to learn about the history and significance of the structure itself as well as the history, language and culture of the Gambian north bank. a spectacular experience - this should be so much more well known and on everyone&#39;s Gambia bucket list. Easily accessible and hugely enlightening. If you are going, give Ebrahim a ring (you can find his number on the door of the fort if he is around) to make sure he gives you the full experience.",

The museum here is just as good as the main national one in Banjul, and because there are so few visitors, you get your own guided tour from the very knowledgeable curator who works there. There&#39;s some interesting history here, and the museum also displays some cultural artifacts from the nearby areas in the north bank. The views from the fortress are nice too. I am based in Fajara, and it was easy to catch a couple of bush taxis, get the ferry and the walk to the fort from the ferry terminal in Barra. The entrance fee is 100 dalasi.",

Worth a short visit to the site and the museum but there is not much shelter on a hot day. The guide was informative and worth having. ",

I left with a much greater understanding of the significance of the river Gambia, the specific role of the UK, and the human cost. Just up the beach from Fort Bullen, a local educator is putting together a black cultural archive. The day we spent in Barra was a really interesting part of the trip.",
