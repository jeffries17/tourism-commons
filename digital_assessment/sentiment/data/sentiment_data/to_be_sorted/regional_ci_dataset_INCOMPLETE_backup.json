  "text": "A tour of Elmina Castle is a must for any visitor to Ghana who is interested in history and an understanding of the infamous slave trade. Dating from 1482, this is the oldest surviving fortress in sub Saharan Africa that housed captured slaves headed for the Americas.  To take a guided tour of the “castle” and its slave dungeons, including the Door of No Return, is both fascinating and incredibly moving, affording insights into the horrific slave trade in ways that cannot be appreciated through books or even films.",

Our excellent guide gave much information about this trade and what it would have been like for these people. It horrified and haunted us. I had heard quite a bit about the slave trade, but not fully understood the size and horror of this mass kidnapping and displacement of people, over so long a period of time and by so many countries occupying Africa at the time. This important part of history warrants greater acknowledgement and understanding.",

There is more than one guide so if two groups happen to cross each other at the same time it can be difficult to hear what is being said. I also think that group sizes should be limited to a certain number. I was disappointed with the toilet facilities. This is a place that is extensively visited and there is no need to have toilets which are substandard. Great guide and very informative.",

  "text": "If you are interested in the history of slavery, Elmina Castle is a must see.  This is not a joyful experience, but yet one that is a worthwhile visit.  The Castle was the largest of the several slave embarkation points along Ghana's coast.  As a reasonably well preserved landmark, there are guides available once you get there.  After an hour or two of walking around the castle, you will be thinking about how this human cruelty ever happened.  The exit known as the \"doorway of no return\" will prompt your thoughts to families with loved ones, children included, who, after months in dungeon quarters, were split apart and never saw each other again.   The only downside was the drive to get there.  With road disarray and construction, it took 3.5 hours to go 100 miles with a hired driver.  At least the continuous scenes of life along the roadside provided a view that was never boring.",

Potem przeszedł w ręce holenderskie i dalej brytyjskie aż do uzyskania przez Ghanę niepodległości w roku 1957 .Pomimo upływu wieków nadal prezentuje się bardzo atrakcyjnie . Miał przez wieki bardzo duże znaczenie handlowe a razem z innymi fortyfikacjami znaczenie militarne . Najczęściej jest kojarzony z niechlubnym handlem niewolnikami. To min  stąd niewolnicy wysyłani byli statkami do Ameryki .Do zobaczenia są lochy i cele w których przetrzymywano niewolników . Dawny portugalski kościół na placu zamkowym pełni obecnie rolę muzeum . Obejrzeć można również ufortyfikowane tarasy zamkowe z armatami chroniącymi przed agresorami . W głównym budynku jest też możliwość zakupu lokalnych pamiątek na kilku stoiskach . Po zamkowych pomieszczeniach można przemieszczać się swobodnie . Z różnych miejsc mamy ciekawe widoki na port rybacki i lagunę . Warto z tej okazji skorzystać .",

  "text": "Elmina castle is a must-do, especially for Westerners. Don't be turned off by the aggressive sellers approaching you as you arrive. Ignore them and keep walking. Once at the entrance, it is calm and friendly. Our guide was very knowledgable, answered unexpected questions well, was friendly and warm. The tour of course walks you through the dark history of this slave trading castle. Hard to hear at times, but a necessary education to fully understand the history and how it impacts generations to come. There is an opportunity near the end to offer libations to the ancestors and give money to sponsor a wreath in their honor. \n\nAt the end I highly recommend shopping at the 2 (maybe 3?) small shops. We did not negotiate prices here, and it was still much less than the shopping we did later in Accra. And these shops do not have highly assertive salesmen. \n\nThere is a small \"museum\" as well, but it was just educational boards to read and we didn't find it of much interest following the great tour.",

When the Portuguese erected this fortress in 1482, they built it to last. 540 years later the battlements stand strong and the hardwood floors and rafters are worn smooth with the passage of time. \n\nSpend an hour or two walking freely about the bastions and interior spaces. The sea breezes and commanding views provide ample incentive for reflective pauses. There’s even a small restaurant in the northeast corner where visitors can take refreshments and watch the townspeople’s fishing boats venturing to and fro. \n\nI traveled to Elmina castle with a local and we didn’t pay an entrance fee or hire a guide, but guides were standing ready to provide a tour. If visitors do some light reading prior to arrival, it’s quite a nice experience to do alone, at your own pace.\n\nMy only regret is that the government of Ghana doesn’t put a little more funding towards the maintenance of the window fittings and other small aspects of the building. Elmina Castle is a monument to engineering and exploration, as well as a testament to man’s cruelty during the colonial period.",

The tour and content was just enough and perfectly timed given the heat. There is a rate for Ghanian's and one for tourists both of which are affordable. I would highly recommend!",

  "text": "Cape Coast Castle, located on Ghana’s central coast, is one of the most significant historical sites in West Africa. This UNESCO World Heritage Site stands as a powerful reminder of the transatlantic slave trade, offering visitors a deeply emotional and educational experience.\n\nHistorical Significance\n\nBuilt by the Swedes in the 1650s and later controlled by the British, Cape Coast Castle was a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade. The castle’s dungeons, where enslaved Africans were held before being shipped to the Americas, leave a haunting impression. Walking through these dark, airless rooms gives a chilling glimpse into the suffering endured by countless men and women.\n\nTour Experience\n\nGuided tours are available, led by knowledgeable guides who provide a detailed and moving account of the castle’s history. The Door of No Return, through which captives were forced onto slave ships, is one of the most powerful stops on the tour. However, there is also the Door of Return, symbolizing the resilience of African descendants who revisit their ancestral homeland.\n\nArchitecture & Scenic Views\n\nBeyond its somber history, the castle itself is an impressive structure, featuring whitewashed walls and breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean. The contrast between the beauty of the surroundings and the tragic history within the walls adds to the site’s emotional impact.\n\nMuseum & Exhibits\n\nThe on-site museum provides valuable context with artifacts, documents, and displays about the slave trade, Ghanaian culture, and colonial history. It’s a great addition to the tour, helping visitors gain a deeper understanding of the past.\n\nVerdict\n\nCape Coast Castle is a must-visit for history enthusiasts, students, and anyone seeking to understand the impact of the transatlantic slave trade. While the experience can be heavy and emotional, it is an important reminder of history and resilience. The only drawback is that the site can get crowded during peak tourist seasons, and some areas could use better maintenance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nA visit to Cape Coast Castle is not just a tour—it’s an unforgettable lesson in history, humanity, and remembrance. Highly recommended for anyone traveling to Ghana.",

There are three places where tributes of flowers can be laid - try to take natural flowers so that they can degrade naturally and, I suppose, become one with the castle.\n\nThis is not a place to take happy snaps, and if you lack melanin, just hang back, be quiet, and recognise that it is our kind who were the masters.

Both type of rooms were clean although the bathrooms are basic.\nWhile there I attended a painting workshop which was good fun.\nThe staff are helpful & friendly, the food tasty.\nI love this place and am already planning a return visit.

  "text": "Visiting SWOPA is a must for anyone who truly wants to get in touch with ghanaian culture. The rooms are amazing and the food is delicious. The pottery and weaving workshops are highly advisable. The shop offers all kinds of traditional pottery and baskets at very reasonable prices. Having lived in Ghana for a while, I know what the right prices are for things here. Usually when you want to buy something, you have to bargain. Locals will then ask ridiculous prices sometimes because they can see you're not Ghanaian. At SWOPA all prices are fixed and all objects are labeled with their price. This makes for a very pleasant and fair shopping experience. If you are interested in buying traditional art or pottery: this is the place to do so. The people are very friendly and for a small fee, someone can drive you around the mesmerising and peaceful landscape.",

Took Arts classes in the morning and went on several different tours in the afternoon. My brain if fully expanded. The staff are very accommodating and were eager to help as much as needed. Sirigu is up in the most northern part of rural Ghana and was quite a bit more arid and hot as compared to the coast. Took an afternoon tour off grounds and a walking tour of area painted traditional homes. Albert, our tour guide, was very knowledgeable about the area and history. Faustina, the coordinator of the arts classes was invested in our success and enjoyment of the crafts. \n\nThe guest house facilities were rustic but clean. Round traditional huts with electricity and running water (most of the time) Not a 5 star hotel, but mostly clean and comfortable. The extra 15 cedis was well worth the air conditioning.  Electricity was partially solar powered so even with lights out fans and lights work. Water pressure and warmth was great. Food was ok. Food choices were limited.  I will definitely be going back when others come to visit.   We stayed 3 days which was a good amount of time.  ",

Unfortunately taking of pictures within the museum itself isn't allowed, hence the lack of pictures here. A visit there starts off with a walk through the courtyard (after paying a N300 entry fee) and its scattering of a few displays of artwork and information boards, followed by a walk through the interior area which turns out to be much more expansive than it appears from the outside. The interior contains a sizable display of different artifacts from several Nigerian tribes. It's mostly a self-guided tour (I.e. no tour guide) but most of the arts on display have small signs attached to them providing basic information about each artifact. \n\nWith some investment to make the place a bit more modern and lively, the museum has potential to be a very good tourist attraction.",

  "text": "Good location, lots of resources, great learning, and everything to make a good museum. The curators are knowledgeable, but a lot more can be done in terms of preservation, lighting, an using multi media to enhance the experience of the visitors like the shooting of the late head of state, which the Mercedez Benz is present. Over all, I will recommend the visit, worth the time and ticket is great",

But I was truly dissapointed with all of the trash in the courtyard area.  I would think this would be part of the up-keep of the place.  While there I saw someone wheel barrel trash out to the courtyard near the fence and dump it.  Inside was well kept but you could tell it the case displays need a refresh.",

You actually feel some of the pain and anguish as you hear the story which is told by a group of well educated guides in detail who invite questions and challenges to the message. They are simply insuring that our history will never be rewritten and I truly appreciate them.",

It is certainly an emotionally impactful place, but I also felt that a rather crude over-emphasis on emotional impact during the tour detracted from the overall experience.",

  "text": "I personally love going to Lekki Market to shop for dresses made with Ankara fabric, interesting local art work, or other furnishing pieces.  It is hands down one of my favorite places to visit in Lagos.   It is also a great stop when I am hosting visitors to Lagos, because they can get fabric in the market and find tailors to sew it into whatever creations, buy ready-made pieces, wood carvings, raffia goods, get their market haggling experience, etc.  Prices are usually reasonable (after you have done a bit of bargaining, of course).  And I love the variety of options that can be found here.  The market is relatively organized, but be prepared for the noise of generators, if the power is out.  The road leading to the market is in really terrible condition, and even worse when it rains so be wary of going there in a sedan car.  There is also a N200 charge to park your car in the lot so make sure you have spare cash.",

Canvas art is of very high quality, prices are reasonable considering the talent and they will roll them and pack in a tube for easy travel. You can negotiate a bit but don't insult the artists- they are very talented and could command much higher prices if they had a better setup. Getting there is a huge turnoff, the Lagos State officials should be ashamed- can the Ministry of Art and Culture not build a large open-air facility for the artists to have stalls and properly display there work? This is something they have done very well in countries like Senegal, Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Madagascar. Something simple but clean, organized and easy to access for tourists and visitors. On the day I visited, there was so much standing water that we had to go back and switch cars. The potholes are insane, the area lacks ambiance for tourists and there isn't any signage. When we arrived the Japanese Embassy delegation decided to not even get out of the car because the generators were running and blowing black smoke on you at the entrance. Not a very nice welcome. \n\nThe art is amazing, local and ambiance not so much. ",

  "title": "Typical Lagos Market with the added bonus of a craft section",
  "rating": 4,
  "travelDate": "2018-02",
  "publishedDate": "2018-08-06",
  "text": "This is a market i have been too very often. It is a typical market that sells the usual items you will find around Lagos. However, it is cleaner than most Lagos markets and that is a plus. The road leading to the market has been fixed and so access is a lot easier than it used to be.\n\nIt is a very safe and sane space. It is also not far from the beaches along the coastal line of Lagos. You feel the usual Lagos bustle but the market is far from crowded and the stalls are well set out.\n\nThe craft section is a big attraction of foreigners and expats. The downside of its popularity is that the crafts have become a lot pricier than they used to be. The good news is that this is an old fashion market (it is not a superstore with fixed prices) and it is a game of negotiation so when the seller goes high, you should start with a counter offer that is at least 50% lower than the asking price. Be prepared to haggle on price as this is the most fulfilling part of the experience.\n\nEnjoy your visit to this quaint and niche market.",

  "title": "The Elmina Castle Experience marred by leeches outside the walls!",
  "rating": 4,
  "travelDate": "2022-12",
  "publishedDate": "2022-12-23",
  "text": "There were 5 of us in the group and the cost of entry & tour totalled £11.96 converted to £ which I thought wasn't bad at all. A warning to everyone, as soon as you arrive in the castle parking area you're pounced on by the street sellers! It's quite unnerving especially if you have senior citizens within the group. They were like leeches & hounds. Note: don't give them your name when they ask, I worked out that what they'll do is get a shell from the sea which is of course free. Write a welcome note on the shell and charge you the earth for it claiming the money which can be accepted in Dollars or sterling will be donated to a local school? they even had badges on lanyards, not sure stipulating what though! probably a discount card of some sort? I was surprised they didn't have high visibility bibs on to give it the full official effect!. This all happens when you're on the tour of course. I'll come back to this afterwards.\n\nThe tour guide started, they tried to pack as many visitors into the group which I felt lessoned the experience as I had questions, lots! well, if I'm travelling this far I want to know things as well. Personally I felt the tour was rushed because there was always another group behind us ready to enter the areas of the castle. \n\nThe stories were horrendous, makes me think the English can't be the worst slave traders as the castle was ruled by the Dutch & the Portuguese and after by the English. The slave quarters were a sight to see, I'm not surprised the ruler of the castle died young, what with the diseases going around back then. Imagine being a slave and being a sex slave to the ruler? unimaginable.\n\nThere were a lot of places to buy souvenirs but pricy in my opinion, especially the books. I think I'll read about it online. Watch out for the steep stairs, not very disability friendly but then again, the country hasn't moved pace with other countries in the world and there's no rush for it. If you've seen the roads, so called footways and general infrastructure you'll know what I mean.  \n\nAfter the tour was over we walked around and I thought to myself \"Why don't they give this place a lick of paint and do a little bit of maintenance? it was falling apart  especially with the salt in the air. The washrooms weren't clearly signed, I thought we'd had to use the corner until we saw a sign on top of some stairs. You could tell a place by it's toilets and it wasn't great but what alternative was there?. \n\nExiting the draw bridge we were mobbed by the leeches and hounds, it was terrible. The castle car park should be out of bounds to these things. It got so bad it caused arguments in the group as one of the senior citizens were hounded so much he was confused about how much to give so he just whipped out £10 but they jumped on him and wanted more. We had to detach him from the mob and usher him into the vehicle for his own safety. I did give them £5 but then they came out with all the teary eyed puppy dog stories of \"I need to feed my family\" \"my  children needs to go to school\" \"Brexit, Covid, War in Ukraine!\" hey, the Tories are always using that line so I'll jump on the band wagon whilst I still can!. \n\nWhat these leeches will do is thrust a form in front of you showing amounts of previous donations from previous visitors, obviously high amounts to persuade you to part with money. When I handed over £5 the cheeky leech said \"you should double it, it'll help the children\". Yeah right, more like help him. I told him where to go and it was all that I had but he still badgered me until I closed the car door on his face, he continued through the window. It was one of the worst experiences on my travels, nothing in comparison to the street sellers, they're tame in comparison to these blood suckers.  \n\nI doubt Elmina Castle's management team will take any notice. Going by the state of the buildings the things outside are the least of there worries, it's just about getting as many through the door as possible. \n\nOne time thing for me, I wouldn't dream of entering the car park if you paid me. Only way to get around this is be dropped at the entrance of the castle by the draw bridge. If security woke up and did their job probably they'll keep the leeches & hounds from trespassing & vastly improving the experience otherwise, a thumbs down from me but the tour was educational and an interesting insight into the tragic things that happened behind these walls.",

And it wasn't even my first time yet I felt the same sense of sorrow and trepidation as the first time I visited about 20 years ago. \nIt was also a time to feel pride for the bravery of my ancestors. Those who fought to end this phase of inhumanity and evil. Evil that was inflicted even with a so-called church on the premises. \n\nKwamena was our tour guide and narrator. Excellent work, Kwamena. He told the story well, with the perfect amount of detail and expression. He also looked out for our safety, ensuring that the children especially were secured away from potential hazards such as when he opened the floor flaps to the water wells and dungeons. \n\nThere are several excellent books being sold on site, at the entrance and at the end of the tour, along with souvenirs. Even Shea butter and shittor! We got the children some hand flicked drums which has kept their attention since!\n\nThere is a small museum on site as well. \n\nBeware the hecklers in the car park who will harass you to buy their paintings. I requested a shell that they design with your name and it makes a cute little souvenir but agree the price at the start and if they get grumpy, walk away. They are nice people but they're a bit too much.\n\nOverall, this place is a must-see for all visitors and locals alike. Thank you, Kwamena.",

  "text": "We also went up to their chapel and the offices; was quite a solemn experience. Then took us to the male and female dungeons where our people were overcrowded, slept, died, defecated, and for the females menstruated. Many died before the ship arrived due to starvation and inhumane conditions. On the grounds of the dungeons, you will see what they wore, the awful stench would hit your noses but what got me sad was when he got to the door of no return; a small metallic gate.\n\nNow I had a problem because I did not see any food vendor or an eatery, aside from the several souvenir shops for people to buy from. I had the same problem at Afadjato. I would strongly suggest they put up an eatery for visitors to have good local food to enjoy as all of that adds to the beauty of the site. We were there for more than 2 hours and did not see any sign of a food vendor on the premises, rather we had to go into town for something to eat. Then again, I had snacks in my bag and that served us well till hunger set in and we left to the next place.t. Just outside the premises you will have a lot of options to pick from so we did that and had our fill\n\nI recommend an eatery be set up outside the castle",

By far the most aggressive touts I encountered in Ghana, who made me feel very unsafe and I would would just advise caution if you plan to visit. \n\nIf you opt otherwise, there are multiple other castles to visit, including at Cape Coast where touts were much more manageable - and the tours were very informative, interesting and sad.",

Los portugueses fueron los primeros en ocupar Cape Coast en 1555, lugar al que llamaron Cabo Corso. La Compañía Sueca de África construyó un fuerte en 1653, primero de madera y después de piedra, y lo llamaron Carolusburg por el rey Carlos X de Suecia. Cape Coast, es otra de las ciudades destacadas, conocida como Oguaa es una ciudad de habla Fante, posee un precioso castillo que data del siglo XVII. Fue construido por los suecos y se convirtió rápidamente en el centro de operaciones de la posterior incursión británica. También famosa por su Universidad enfrentamientos entre las potencias europeas para conseguir su dominio. En 1663 fue tomado por los daneses, luego por los holandeses y finalmente pasó a poder de los británicos, que en 1757 reconstruyeron el castillo, dañado por los bombardeos. Todos los ocupantes tuvieron a su vez que combatir contra los nativos del lugar. Imprescindible la visita. ",

The guides take you around and share so much information starting from the arrival of the Portuguese in 1471, the Dutch and then the British. The Tour lasts about 1.5 hours. A must for anyone visiting the area.\n",

  "text": "Cette basilique de Ouidah , dite de \" L'Immaculée Conception \" , qui date de 1909 ,  a été longtemps Cathédrale de la Colonie du Dahomey instituée en 1884 , avec Ouidah comme capitale . Elle est le fruit de la persévérance des Missionnaires venus au Bénin dès 1884 .  En 1954 , elle perd son statut de siège du vicariat apostolique au profit de Porto Novo , qui devient capitale de Dahomey . Elle devient basilique en 1989 ; \n\nLa construction de cette basilique dans le style \" néo Gothique \" a été faite de 1903 à 1909 , grâce à la participation de toute la communauté de Ouidah y compris celle de confession Vaudou , du fait de cette solidarité africaine unique en son genre !!\n\nEn arrivant cette basilique se remarque . La façade comporte un clocher de section carrée , mais inachevé , encadré par deux contreforts ouverts de lancettes en vitrail , le tout peint en gris clair . Le porche à la base du clocher , est encadré par une haute portée en arc de plein cintre à voussures peintes en blanc . Le haut du clocher est ouvert d'abats sons , et il est décoré de corniches peintes . Une petite statue d'Evêque ( peut être Monseigneur Dartois initiateur de cet édifice) se trouve au devant du clocher . \n\nEn entrant , on découvre la nef unique , en forme de croix latine , qui est à cinq travées éclairées par des baies géminées à vitraux surmontées d'oculus . Le transept est peu saillant et ouvert de vitraux dans le style de la nef . La voute est de style lambrissé ( bois)  et est portée par des structures métalliques , ce qui lui donne une légèreté de bonne facture . \nLe choeur est placé dans une abside quadrangulaire ouverte de vitraux historiés . L'autel avec ses décorations simples , est placé contre le mur pignon sous une voute débordante en berceau . Une statue de la Vierge Marie au dessus de la croix , constitue les seules ornementations .\n\nLa visite de cet édifice est instructive sur le style de l'époque coloniale française , qui reprend celui des édifices français , mais avec des touches de couleurs d'inspiration africaine .  L'utilisation de matériaux légers , métal et bois , est déjà à la mode . \n\nA l'extérieur , une grotte réalisée en pierre de taille , sert pour les cérémonies en l'honneur de la Vierge notamment le 15 Aout",

The artifacts and images from the slave trade are horrific and it really makes you think about the dreadful conditions these people were forced into. Well worth the time to tour around. \n\nEntrance is free although, at the end of the tour, you donate what you want to the guide. Guides can be conducted in both French and English.",

I was amazed to discover that in history, it was the Ghanian Chiefs that made the decision to 'sell' his people to the slave traders. All about obtaining trading goods in return. Very sad to see the conditions in which those slaves were kept and treated.  Travelled in Dec  2018 & Jan 2019. I highly recommend purchasing the DVD video and supporting the artists in surrounding shops, they make the most incredible items.  Ghanian people are beautiful people and they do everything to make this tour worthwhile. In addition, I feel the Ghanian Government could employ their amazing  'Dance Troupe Artists',  to put on daily dance displays, (in their traditional fabric costumes,  at the Castle, to reflect the history and culture.  The Government need to step up their support, for International travellers, to give them richer cultural experiences.  Talented Ghanians are crying out for work, give them jobs  so that they can be part of the travellers rich cultural experiences! ",

There were many artifacts dating back centuries, however, one needs to know that you are not permitted to take any photographs at all, which truly is a pity and ruins the overall feel for visitors.

Very nice friendly guides and staff who were quite happy to show my group around.",

So, even if you have a busy schedule, you can pop in. We spent about 30 minutes in all, to have a quick look at all the galleries. \n\n-Centrally located in Onikan, Lagos Island. It is adjacent to Ikoyi and close to Victoria Island. It is easily accessible, especially if you know the roads around the area.\n\n-Free parking in large car park. \n\n-Nice grounds with trees. Nice place to have a picnic with family/friends.\n\n-Nice museum shop, though dimly lit.\n\nPoints against:\n-The air conditioning was off is the largest gallery. They said \"currently under repairs\"\n\n-There's room for improvement in the display and labelling of items, as well as in other aspects of the Museum.\n\n-Photos not allowed in galleries. Why?",

The building is quite old and there is no air conditioning, but the employees are trying very hard to make the whole experience nice. The entrance fee is 200 Nairas for Nigerians and 300 for tourists, plus the tour guide will ask you for some money in the end, but you tip him as much as you want (I gave him 1000 Nairas because my Nigerian friend told me that was enough). The museum currently hosts two exhibitions - one about Nigerian culture and the other one about the country's governments over the last couple of decades, and both are worth seeing. ",

  "text": "Yes, this is not the British, Metropolitan or Gulbenkian museums.  Nonetheless, this Nigerian museum contains some stunning works of African wood and bronze artwork that you will never experience anywhere else and that will remind you where Picasso's source Cubist  inspiration came from! (Let's not forget that the British Museum stole 2000 bronze works from Nigeria's city of Benin, never to be returned!).This is art from the heart whereas so much Western art is, as critic George Steiner said, \"more interesting for its THEORY than  for its art.\" I really think it's very worthwhile seeing this museum for its ART (and not just to be pampered through beautiful galleries as in the US and  Europe).",

Make sure you bargain (I took my Nigeria  bf which helped!) and lots of cash so you can stock up on everything there. I could have spent a lot more time there buying gifts and things for myself but we ran out of cash woops! The other thing is that we went in the middle of the day so it was really hot, and everyone seemed to feeling the heat. I would recommend going morning or later afternoon/evening. Didn't take any photos bc the ones on here already are exactly what the market are like. ",

Clothing, Wine and hard liquor, vegetables and fruits, plastic day to day items...first timer can easily spend like 2 to 3 hours here. Shop keepers are cooperative and make you feel safe from anti social elements. The more polite and respectful you are, chances are more of getting a bigger better deal. Be very careful as to what they say and what you end up buying, especially Pearls. Parking too is safe",

I'd rather just have a fixed fair price, but the problem is you are constantly going to have to negotiate because the traders mark up the price so high almost all  the time; you'd find that from $50 you'd end up bargaining at the end of it all you'd probably would pay $20. So if you have to go to this market, go with your iron boots and some water and do get ready to bargain! bargain! bargain! and oooh also do get ready to be pulled by traders who want you to visit their stores but it is generally quite safe",

The history of the trans Atlantic slave trade and African kingdoms that existed during the time is truly a revealing one.\n\nIt's amazing how black communities in the diaspora (in places such as South America and the Caribbean) have preserved certain elements of their culture for centuries and the striking similarities between those cultures and that of certain West African communities today. \n\nP.S. This museum needs a face lift however... without damaging the history; I felt that it wasn't in the best of shape.",

This was a former slave Portuguese Fort that has been turned into a museum and you walk around rooms where pictures describe the unspeakable horrors slaves endured. We were on tour and the guide had arranged an English speaking guide for us who's a decent from a Brazilian slave who repatriated to Benin after slavery ended in Brazil. Of course, he admitted that his great grandfather at the time did not have knowledge of which country his ancestors had come from originally in Africa but he was following the wave of Brazilians who decided to call Ouidah home. \n\nI can't imagine visiting the museum without a guide because many of the pictures do not come with stories and that means you will miss out on so much. Plus the guide can help take you to the gate of no return which I think is part of the museum and also to other memorials which are there to honor slaves and the lives lost. It's a must do trip but just make sure to bring a guide!",

It gives a \"no holds barred\" account of the way in which the slaves were taken, held, mistreated and eventually made to exit the fort to walk, in chains, down a mile long route to the coast where they would then board the slave ships for the middle passage across the Atlantic to the Americas. Being located in the original fort at Ouidah leaves the traveler with the sense of impending doom and helplessness that the stolen lives must have felt at the time.",

Ce musée est gratuit et l'on peut faire un don . Je recommande la visite de ce lieu  ,qui fait honneur au mécénat . Dans le jardin interieur on.peut découvrir des œuvres en rapport avec le vaudou qui est largement pratiqué à Ouidah avec la fête début janvier. La statue du dieu  vaudou Tohossou , dieu de l'eau à trois têtes avec son serpent , ainsi que Mami Wata , la redoutable  animent le jardin au gazon presque british . A voir absolument !!",

Verkauf und Nötigung vor der Tür und dann... Ausländer zahlen, Einheimische ein paar Kupeken. Einheimische gehen da nur sowieso hin, wenn sie eigeladen werden. Die sind gegenüber der Sklaverei ganz entspannt. Immerhin haben die Fante ja mit den Kolonialisten kooperiert, um ihre Feine - hauptsächlich Ashanti - vom  Hals zu halten. Aber zurück zur \"door of never return\" in Elminia. Eine ziemlich zerfallene Burg, vielleicht mal wichtig zu sehen, aber 1x reicht. Finde ich. Arogant gegenüber Touristen und verdammt wenig Aufarbeitung oder Dokumentation. Die Brücken...naja. halb vier aufstehnen, Fahrt zu dem Park....dann im dunkeln ewig durchs Gebüsch. JA, es hat schon was in den Wipfeln über diesen Holzbalken. Es ist sowas wie: wichtig zu sehen, egal ob es mein Leben kostet. Ein gutes Gefühl hat man dabei bestimmt nicht. Gut, daß das die Dänen gebaut haben.....es lohnt sich jedenfalls.",

  "text": "I recently spent a couple of hours touring the \"slave castle\". It's hard to be whistling a happy tune as you enter the castle, once it hits you what happened there. The gravity of its size and its purpose hits you in your soul. At it's height the castle shipped off 4,000 slaves a year, mostly to the Americas.  The tour guides are both friendly and knowledgeable   The visit to this slave castle was definitely worth my time and money (the \"tour\" is NOT handicap accessible!). \nWhile the castle was worth the drive, the drive itself is not!  Ghana and a few other countries have this curious habit of placing rather large speed bumps on its major two-lane highways - a lot of them (sometimes 3 or 4, one right after another). There must be close to 100 of them (about every 1/2 to 1 mile) between Accra and Cape Coast. They can rattle your teeth even when driving slowly over them!  And of course, cars pass another on curves or going up hills that will get your heart pumping, depending upon how fast or aggressive your driver is. No, there is not a major hospital with modern technology nearby, in case one of the drivers makes a misjudgment (I saw one such accident on the way to the coast. Thankfully it was not a major head-on collision but it was close enough!",

The tour was provided by an employee, a younger girl who was excellent in providing information about the castle and the early days of the slave trade. The tour was in depth and provided a very eye opening account of what went on in this place. Overall this tour was well done and worth the 3h drive from Accra. This trip and a visit to Kukum National Park is do-able in a day from Accra and back.",

A spine chilling journey through dungeons where 150 humans were chained together & made to live a life which was wort then hell. The terrible treatment of humans for the quest for wealth via the Portuguese, Dutch &, English,held in varying times of Elmina Castle. A must see and experience and the preservation of this repulsive thing that was slavery!\n\nInside and out, Elmina Castle is a very imposing edifice indeed.  Its main claim to fame is that it's the oldest building in sub-Saharan Africa. It was established by the Portuguese in 1482 although most of what we see today is Dutch, post 1637. The British took over the Castle in 1872 and held it until Ghanaian independence in 1957. Subsequent restoration has been done by the Ghanaian government. Visitors are directed to an important building in the main courtyard, now a museum which tells the entire history of the area. It's in a former Portuguese church (1596), which was turned by the Dutch into a market. The Portuguese, Dutch and Brits were all involved in the slave trade and the first port of call on the guided tour is the slave dungeons. Hundreds at any one time were incarcerated here before being led down a tunnel to the \"door of no return\", a narrow slot, which at one time gave on to the sea, which has since receded. Boats then carried the slaves to ships, which took the captives direct to the Americas. We were also shown a gallery, from where the Governor chose female slaves, who were then taken to the Governor's substantial quarters. It's likely that the women who subsequently gave birth were released. Similar stories are told at other Ghanaian landmarks, e.g. the Cape Coast Castle and the James Fort Prison, Accra. \n\nDefinitely one visit",

The Church was right next to the dungeons, a similar scenario that also plays out when we see the stark contrast between the cell where the condemned slave was kept and the next door cell for unruly soldiers.We leave Elmina with the commitment that never again shall humanity witness the level of brutality that was witnessed and perpetrated during the slave trade era.",

The door of no return is something you need to experience. The cell where they left unruly slave to starve to death, the womens dungeon where the governor would pick women to rape.... horrific. But what is really disgusting and never ever mentioned is the fact that it was Africans selling Africans into slavery.",

Our group was tired after a full week but after the tour, agreed it was worth getting up and out early and taking a 7 hour drive instead of a 45 min flight to be able to take the tour before our departure that evening. Admission was GHC 40 per person for non-Ghana citizens as of Feb 1, 2020. The tour lasts about 45 minutes and is included with admission. Be sure to wear sunscreen and sunglasses or a hat. Water is also a good idea on hot days. ",

  "text": "Although I am pakeha/abroni/white this tour of the cape coast slVe castle was a very emotional experienxe.\nLearning what was done to the 12 million slaves taken from Africa and the estimated million that went through the coast castles was confronting. The suffering of the slaves should never be forgotten and we have an obligation to learn what happened to these people.\nI am stunned that i did not know how many were lost to slavery. Surely this is the greatest loss to humankind .\nThe guides were knowledgable. The castle is reasonably well preserved. We were taken through all the levels from dungeons and the door of no return to the 3rd floor hovenore and european quarters.\nYou can wander round on your own. I am insure whether this makes a diffrrence to the entrance price of 40 cedis. ($12NZD approx)\nIt is hot in Ghana so this tour will make you sweat if you are from cooler climates. Take water and a fan. I have been carrying round a wet flannel to cool my self off.\nA down side is being harrassed by hawkers outside the castle. Just be firm with your \"no\" if you are not interested.",

  "text": "This castle is located at a place which is about 180 kms. from Accra & takes around 3 hours (one way) to reach.\n\nCape coast Castle is a historical monument with a sordid & tragic story to tell.\n\nThis was the place where black man & women were captured from the whole of West Africa,, brought here & kept in the basement of this castle for onward shipment to Americas, Europe & the Carribean.\n\nThe men & women were kept separately in underground dungeons in the most unimaginable conditions.\n\nIn a 800-100 sq.feet chamber approximately 200 men were kept. They ahd to eat there, sleep there & do everything in that chamber only till the time they were shipped abroad.\n\nOf the total numbers only about 65% could survive & shipped out of the castle.\n\nThe rest died in that very chamber.\n\nFemales were kept seperately & were subjected to continuous sexual exploitation.\n\nOne shudders to think that the governor of the castle was staying in the same castle lavishly.\n\nThe Britishers built a church just above the dungeon where slaves were kept like animals , were tortured & many even died.\n\nWhat an irony !!!",

I'd suggest that if you're attending with below 10 kids you do the explaining yourself. The museum is good to get some knowledge of the local cultures that are fast fading away. The Nigerian Government part of the Museum is also a bit interesting especially for the presence of the Car in which a Nigerian President was shot. If you find yourself in Lagos, take a trip there for cultural purposes. Very very cheap entry fee too.",

  "text": "I visited the National Museum during my January 2015 trip to Lagos. I was extremely disappointed by what I saw. First of all, there was no power. Given that this is Nigeria, that in itself was not disappointing...what was disappointing was that the \"National Museum\" of a country as large as Nigeria did not appear to have an emergency power generator.The attendants indicated no desire to provide any customer service, they appeared to be marking time until 4pm. There were virtually no exhibits to speak about - the one area that they claimed had exhibits could not be accessed if there was a power outage. All the more reason to have a generator! Outside the main museum, the entry to the hut used to store the bullet-ridden Mercedes car of the late dictator, Murtala Muhammed, was being used to wash cars. The entire scene was both comical and sad, and reflective of how rotten the core of Nigeria truly is. ",

You are not allowed to take pictures, but ironically you can touch some of the artifacts. Nigeria has a very rich history and deserves a much more appealing \"National Museum\". The most interesting part is a little shack outside the museum (but being part of it), with a brief historic outline of Nigeria's history after Independence and the original bullet-riddled Mercedes in which president Murtala Mohamed was assassinated.",

You can take your date to the museum instead of the usual cliched cinema/shopping mall. \nI am not sure if the museum kitchen is still function though. it used to serve delicious ,affordable meals back in the day",

Very enthusiastic guide, included in the entrance fee, who actually told things that were not on the labels of the objects. \nAt the moment the masterpieces from the Ife culture are not in the museum as they are on loan to other museums across the world as that part is being renovated.\n\nAs a national museum it's a bit of a disappointment \"is this all?\", after all it's the national museum in the countries largest city by far! But it is still a must if you visit Lagos as it gives some insight into the history of the different parts of Nigeria.\nNote: the outside has a playground which is not recommended for children as it is too worn down, i.e. dangerous.",

  "text": "The museum exhibits Nigeria's ancient civilizations and traditional religions. You can learn more about the different ethnic groups in Nigeria. Moreover, the museum displays Nigeria's government of yesterday and today. Everything is labelled clearly but you can also get someone to show you around for some tips. This is not a European standard museum and you can see that few Nigerians have visited or know about the museum. Still, I think it's worth a visit as you can learn about some old traditions and see some local art.",

  "text": "My colleague took me here to learn about the slave trade & to see the Door of no Return. We started at the museum and were able to get an English speaking guide who took me through the museum - it's a little run down and the artefacts are displayed a bit shabbily but they still are able to tell the story of the Portuguese fort well. We were then able to get a different guide to ride in our car as we drove down the slave road to explain the different stops along the way. It was very informative and really helpful to have the guide as there are limited descriptive plaques. We finished at the Python temple where I could hold 2 snakes and have my picture taken.",

  "text": "This rather interesting museum is located in the old Forte de São João Baptista de Ajudá. This fort has an interesting history. With its 5 acres (~2 ha), it was at one time the world’s smallest internationally-recognized political unit. It was built on land given to Portugal by King Haffon of Ouidah in 1721, and remained under Portuguese administrative control until Jul 31, 1961. On Aug 1 of the previous year, Dahomey (now Benin) had become independent, and its new government gave Portugal one year to vacate the premises and move on! When the ultimatum expired, the resident Portuguese population of the fort (2 inhabitants, down from 5 in 1921…) tried to set it on fire, rather than surrender it to the new country. The issue only reached closure in 1975, i.e., after the Portuguese revolution of the previous year, when Portugal recognized Dahomey’s sovereignty over the fort. In 1987, the Fundação Gulbenkian of Portugal funded the full rehabilitation of the historic facility, which now houses Ouidah’s Museum of History.",

Quite a few shops with ready made african wear and some really well made solid african style carved furniture ( everything from wine cupboard to chest of drawers ) . You get the usual tourist souvenirs but there are some more unusual goodies if you look hard enough . A very large range of paintings in different media and for all tastes, from the basic ( something to cover your walls)  to beautiful detailed paintings.\nPrices as in all markets in Africa are variable from expensive to pretty cheap . if you aren't good at haggling I strongly recommend going with someone who knows how to haggle.\nIt is also a good place to buy fresh fruit and vegetables !

The roads were atrocious-- a result of the rains, and I'm told they're repaired after the rainy season.  I wouldn't risk the trip in anything other than a 4WD (one that i didn't care too much about).  That said, it's a nice place to purchase souvenirs and let your tourist dollars trickle down a bit to some local merchants.",

When you get near to the market ask people for the \"arts and crafts\" market as locals are not familiar with the name Lekki market in our experience. The market has a lovely selection of handmade things and you can see people working on their crafts. Bartering is encouraged and vendors all say the price they are giving you is negotiable. Compared to other places we have been to in Asia and Africa we did not feel overly hassled and were able to browse the arts and crafts without too much difficulty. ",

Only that you need to engage each store manager or sales person to get the stories and labels of each article.\n\nThe prices are very low, but haggling over the prices seemed a little more tiring for me this time around. \n\nIn all, it was another interesting evening in Lagos.",

Many stalls are owned by the artist themselves.\n\nTry to avoid the touts Who pretend to be the stall owners and get a commission for bringing a customer.

It's situated behind the \"shanty market\" for lack of a better term.  Once in and after I stopped sweating, they actually have some pretty nice things.  I have some misgivings about whether these items, carvings, stone work, and some paintings are actually produced by the sellers because from one booth to the next, they all look the same.  Nothing stood out as something I just had to have or that I couldn't get a local (Portland, Oregon) jewelry maker to design.  I'm headed up to Abeokuta to see if I can't find authentic pottery and Adire.  ",

Stepping through the gate of the castle was reliving the days of slavery and the slave trade. It can make one get real emotional. It is a good place to take history students so they can see history come alive. The 'door of no return' stood out in my memory so much! It was the little slit in the wall through which slaves were pushed into waiting boats which took them to bigger ships which then took them to other lands. \nI left their with my name written on a shell, welcoming me to the area and to Ghana. There are young people at the gates of the castle who in  friendly manner introduce themselves and ask your name. They get the correct spelling then tell you that you will get a gift at the end of your visit into the castle. When you return to the outside you are given the shell and you are asked for a contribution. I saw a tourist arguing with one youngster as he wanted U$5 for the shell. (The shell did not value that.) It is best to change your money to cedis. 1USD- 5cedis.",

  "text": "Une visite relativement réduite. Le palais d’Abomey est en restauration, donc pas de visite, la partie accessible est seulement une grande cour où vous trouverez les échoppes traditionnelles pour touriste. La visite/tour complète est plus interessante de par les explications du guide. On vous emmènera voir différents palais/cases où à part quelques décorations sur les murs vous ne verrez que des bâtiments vides mais cela reste interessant de par les explications. Le point le plus sympa reste le marché des fétiches vaudou (photos payantes en plus) et la basilique vaudou caméléon où l’on peut rentrer en se déchaussant avant. Le monastère vaudou situé à côté ne se visite pas mais sa décoration est sympa. Parlons du prix : tout est négociable. Le guide qui se présentera à vous devant le palais vous accompagnera pour le circuit en négociant un prix global incluant les différents tickets d’entrée (pour quelles entrées, on se demande). Compter 15K CFA pour le tout. Si vous êtes accompagné d’un béninois, vous aurez plus de chance de réduire le prix. La visite nécessite une voiture avec chauffeur pour se déplacer d’un endroit à un autre.",

  "text": "Le palais est en rénovation. Il n’est pas visitable actuellement. Malgré cela, un employé du service touristique et un guide nous ont proposé de visiter un certain nombre de sites attenants. Après négociations, leurs tarifs se sont montés à 8000 + 10 000 = 18 000 CFA. A cela s’est ajouté la location d’une voiture (indispensable pour une visite), soit 15 000 CFA.\n\nCette visite d’environ 3 heures a été moyennement intéressante. La plus grande partie du temps a été consommée en déplacements, les distances étant très grandes. A part un site, il était impossible d’entrer à cause des rénovations. Pour cette raison il m’est un peu difficile de juger mais il semble que beaucoup de « palais » sont réduits à un petit édifice. Le guide déconseillait d’en visiter d’autres, notamment celui du roi Behanzin, parce que cela conduirait à des « complications » = offrandes à faire…\n\nCe guide était excellent et connaissait sur le bout des doigts l’histoire du Bénin et aussi les détails de la religion vaudoun, point fort de la visite avec un passage au village coeur de cette religion, qui comprend un couvent (inaccessible aux non adeptes). J’ai beaucoup appris, mais cela ne contrebalance pas le coût de la visite et l’indigence des choses à voir.",

  "text": "Abomey a été depuis le premier roi Gangnihesdou ( 1600-1621) jusqu'au dernier Behanzin ( 1889-1894)  un puissant royaume appelé plus tard  royaume du Dahomey ( nom francisé). Ces rois de droit divin et au pouvoir absolu , avaient droit de vie et de mort sur leurs sujets.  Ils pratiquaient la décapitation , sans hésiter.  Ils ont , pendant la période de l'esclavage, vendu nombre de leurs vaincus et de leurs sujets aux négriers européens . Le marché de Ouidah a été florissant pendant des siècles.\n\nLe système royal est entièrement réglé par le roi qui dispose d'un nombre important de concubines qui sont suppervisees par la reine mère.  Les derniers rois utilisaient  des amazones, femmes entraînées à la guerre , qui sont restées fidèles jusqu'à dernier moment pendant la conquête française, qui a déposé le roi Behanzin en 1894 . Avec sa redoutable armée,  le royaume à vassalise les autres royaumes de l'actuel Bénin à l'exception de celui de Hogbonou ( Porto Novo ) où le roi  Joffa avait déjà conclu un accord commercial avec la France en 1882.\nLe roi Behanzin , bien qu'ayant règne que 5 ans , est très populaire , car  il est le symbole de la résistance contre l'envahisseur français   qui a eut du mal à le vaincre, malgré une supériorité numérique et technologique. \n\nLa visite de ce musée est décevante  , par la vétusté des lieux , la médiocrité en valeur des quelques objets et par l'interdiction de prendre des photos , que je considère comme contre productive pour la promotion du site .Seules les explications  du guide sont détaillées et intéressantes. Le seul endroit où les photos sont autorisées est la première cour où les marchands du temple présentent leurs objets pour touristes. A noter que ce qui donne une impression de dégradation sont les tôles rouillées qui ont remplacé les toits traditionnels en paille . De même, les vitrines qui présentent des objets sont tellement sales qu 'on a du mal à les distinguer !\n\nL'entrée est payante 1000 francs pour les beninois et 3000 francs pour les autres .",

Pas grand chose à voir dans les bâtiments et les quelques objets exposés sont poussiéreux et les vitrines suffisamment sales pour empêcher de lire les explications.

They are ancient by the standards in Benin, as they have been constructed around 1830-ish. Unfortunately they did not refurbish ANY of the furniture, maps & graphics hanging on the walls. Most of them are impossible to read. \n\nThey have a much venerated grave of the king Ghezo, which they believe is still with us, as the hut was supposed to be his room. There used to be furniture, but they threw it out, and nobody cared enough to even put a random bed  and some chairs there to pretend that they are the originals. \n\nThere are a few artifacts in the museum - some of them very interesting but in high state of disrepair. By that I mean that they are literally falling apart. The famous  throne with 4 skulls is in a glass cabinet so dirty that you can barely see the shape of that throne.\n\nBut dont be discouraged by all this. Get a guide to tell you the stories behind all that and you will really enjoy your time. ",

Mir wurde noch ein Guide empfohlen, aber 8.000 Naira waren mit zu viel. Natürlich versteht man nicht allzu viel, wenn man ohne Guide den heiligen Hain besichtigt. Zumindest sind im Wald viele Skulpturen und Schreine zu sehen. Auf dem Rückweg bin ich zum Fluss und durfte bei einer Zeremonie zuschauen. Nichts für schwache Nerven, da eine Ziege geköpft wurde. Aber nichtsdestotrotz eine interessante Erfahrungen. \nAm Eingnag ist ein kleiner Souvenirshop, welcher eher Schmuck führt.",

The numerous monkeys along the road to the groove and in the groove are a spectacle to behold as they are used to the people. It is a common sight to see drivers parking their cars to give bananas and other food to these animals who are friendly.\nI advice anyone that is going to Oshogbo or to explore the groove or the town to go with a guide because most of the places are unmarked. It has no signage or directions.  \nIt will do the tourist or visitor so much good to employ the service of  a guide because the guide will take the visitor beyond his or bargain.",

I want to thank Doyin Olosun for a very interesting tour in the Grove. \nAs soon as you step into this sacred virgin forest, you immediately feel the magic all around you, and you sense how you find peace. Here, no trees are getting cut down or animals caught or hunted. The work of Adunni Olorisa (Susanne Wenger) and the Sacred Art Movement is breathtaking and very unique. Monkeys are jumbing around you, hoping that you might have brought some bananas, prayers are being said and blessings given. This place is indeed very sacred for the everyday life of the devotees of the Orisa religion. \nThe Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove is without any doubt a place I would warmly recommend people to experience, with respect for the sacred character of the place.",

Walking through the entire complex and seeing the sharp contrasts between the dungeons where the slaves were holed up and the lavish, expansive quarters of the slave merchants was too much to bear. What agony and dehumanizing pains my ancestors had to go through with the connivance of greedy and selfish collaborators. The huge irony for us was the Church located on the top floor of the Castle. Highly recommended for all interested in slave trade history. Very knowledgeable tour guide make the visit pleasant and highly informative.",

We visited Cape Coast after we had been traveling in Ghana for a few weeks, and had spent time in the north and east, and this really tied a lot of what we had seen and learned together.

  "text": "Wir machten uns auf den Weg zur Besichtigung des UNESCO Weltkulturerbes „Elmina Castle“ — einer ehemaligen Sklavenburg.  \n\nElmina Castle wurde 1482 von den Portugiesen erbaut und ist die älteste von Europäern errichtete Sklavenburg Westafrikas. Im Laufe der Geschichte gehörte sie zu dem niederländischen und britischen Kolonialreich. Ursprünglich wurde die Burg für den Warenhandel zwischen Westafrika und Europa erbaut und erst später zur Sklavenburg umstrukturiert. Noch bis zur Abschaffung der Sklaverei im Jahr 1814 wurden hier ca. 3 Millionen Sklaven aus Ghana, Togo, der Elfenbeinküste und Burkina Faso unter unwürdigen Bedingungen gefangen gehalten. Innerhalb der Festung waren bis zu 600 Männer und 400 Frauen zeitgleich in unterschiedlich großen Kammern inhaftiert. Der einzige Auslass aus der Burg bestand durch die „Door of no return“, das heißt die Sklaven wurden auf Schiffen in die Karibik und nach Nordamerika deportiert.\n\nDas Oberhaupt des Castles war der Gouverneur. Dieser suchte sich Frauen als Geliebte aus. Ergab sich daraus eine Schwangerschaft, waren sie „the lucky ones“, da sie in separaten Häusern untergebracht wurden und somit im Land blieben.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den beengten Zellen, in denen beispielsweise bis zu 150 Frauen auf engstem Raum gefangen gehalten wurden, sind die Privaträume des Gouverneurs großzügig. Von seinen Räumen auf der obersten Ebene an der Spitze der Festung blickt er auf die Soldaten und vor allem auf die Gefangenen herab. Heute genießen wir von hier aus einen fantastischen Blick auf den Atlantik. Über die Mauern der Burg hinaus betrachten wir das Treiben des ca. 200 m entfernten Fischerhafens und des daran anschließenden Marktes. Die Fischer kennzeichnen ihre Boote mit internationalen Flaggen, um da eigene bei der Einfahrt in den Hafen schneller erkennen zu können. Die Eindrücke der Vergangenheit trüben unsere Stimmung, doch wie uns der Guide lehrt, sehen wir dies als Mahnmal der Geschichte, die sich nicht wiederholen sollte.\n\nLetzendlich waren wir alle sehr begeistert von der Burg. Die Führung war super. Sie dauert circa 1,5 bis 2 Stunden. Es gibt auch einen kleinen Shop, in dem man Getränke und Souvenirs kaufen kann.\nToiletten sind auch vorhanden.\nEs is definitv einen Besuch wert! ",

Il expose des artistes africains contemporains, même si vous n'êtes pas passionnés ou que vous n'y connaissez rien, cela vaut le détour. Les pièces sont aérées, les œuvres bien exposées, les guides compétents.\nLe prix d'entrée est libre.\nNe manquez pas le café-boutique. Possibilité de déjeuner, mais le café est un peu cher. Par contre la boutique vaut le coup d’œil, pas donné non plus mais original. Vous y trouverez : bijoux, divers objets en tissus africains : sacs de toutes tailles, houses d'ordinateur, cravates, nappes, mais aussi coussins, trousses de toilettes et surtout de nombreux catalogues sur l'art africains et les expositions de la fondation.\nUn lieu à ne pas manquer, vaut le déplacement jusqu'à Ouidah!",

What a most pleasant experience: the exhibit was very well curated, with a nice mixture of works as far as artists represented, their country of origin, and media used; the setting—a beautifully restored house from the early 1900s—was equally inspiring; the staff was very helpful and friendly; and lastly, the café (reviewed elsewhere) was super charming and cozy. A morning well spent indeed!",

Avec une salle par artiste de différents pays et les explications très éclairantes de notre guide, nous avons pu comprendre et mieux apprécier les œuvres. Chaque artiste a un style bien à lui, utilisant souvent des matériaux de récupération. La visite est complémentaire de celle faite à Cotonou où la fondation a aussi un lieu d'exposition, consacré à un seul artiste.\nL'entrée et la visite est gratuite. On peut terminer par un petit tour au café meublé de façon contemporaine mais avec de magnifiques tissus africains traditionnels.",

  "text": "Sem dúvida a melhor escolha para comprar lembranças. Preços justos para artesãos e para quem compra. Ao contrário das restantes lojas, que têm todas a mesma oferta e misturam peças locais com outras feitas em série na China e objectos de outros países africanos, esta loja tem uma grande variedade de produtos caboverdianos - do artesanato aos doces, licores, sais de banho e muito mais. Tem também os preços bem identificados em escudos caboverdianos e euros, o que não acontece nas restantes lojas (onde o preço varia a cada dia e consoante o comprador). O atendimento é excelente e não há confusões com os trocos entre escudos e euros, em que o comprador fica sempre a perder. Comércio justo e sério para quem compra e quem vende e ainda se contribui para uma boa causa. Aconselho vivamente.",

Nothing like our dull and sunless victorian Museums.But maybe thats changed since I was a child. I thoroughly recommend you see this exhibit  it was glorious. ",

  "text": "I visited this museum to pay homage to Cape Verde's most famous person.  It is situated in an ordinary house in a side street (not her original house I don't think) and contains personal items such as her dresses, hair curlers, favourite coffee mug and ashtray as well as awards and decorations from her singing career.  The story of her life is told in Portuguese, English and (I think) French.  There is a very moving film of her funeral procession when all the local musicians accompanied her coffin to the cemetery playing 'Sodade'.  Also you can listen to a wide selection of her songs on audio.  The museum is excellent value and should be better known.  Perhaps they could have more of her CDs on sale, though I did buy one.",

Le musée Zinsou de Ouidah est d’abord la rénovation d’une œuvre architecturale unique.\n\nOuidah qui se veut « villes de tous les patrimoines » avec son histoire dense honore les artistes contemporains africains. Cyprien Tokoudagba, Samuel Fosso, Romuald Hazoumé, SolyCissé, le musée d’arts africains de Ouidah vous donne rendez-vous pour une autre facette de l’Afrique. Une facette qui jusque-là ne pouvait être visitée qu’à Paris, New-York, et autres grandes villes occidentales.\n\nTrès belle initiative ce musée dont j'ai beaucoup apprécié la visite.",

Advies: neem een vertrouwde chauffeur mee bv vanuit je hotel en fotografeer mensen pas na dat je toestemming hebt gekregen.\nIn de stad Quidah bevind zich het Portugese Fort waar in het verleden de slaven werden verzameld en door de Portugezen naar o.a. Brazilië werden verscheept, het Fort is nog geheel intact en is nu als museum en dagelijks te bezoeken.   \nNa het bezoek aan het museum kan je via de marktplaats naar de kust rijden, ca. 5 km., over dit pad moesten de slaven lopen naar de schepen die voor de kust lagen. Op dit pad staan nog de beelden waarlangs ze moesten lopen om afscheid te nemen van hun land. Ook bevindt zich halverwege dit pad een dorpje waar VOODOO priesters hun rituelen uitvoeren. Fotografeer niet zonder toestemming!\nAangekomen bij de kust staat er nu een monument op de plaats waar de slaven Afrika hebben verlaten, al met al een zeer indrukwekkende locatie.\nLangs de kust kan je dan weer terug naar Cotonou.",

It had various merchants with an array of items, from paintings, carvings, jewellery, books etc. I was fortunate to have acquired some beautiful pieces in the past. That was about 5 years ago.\nI visited the market last month and was a bit disappointed. It seemed to have been improved but not sure it adds credit to it. You have somewhat more solid concrete stalls, but no order to the arrangements of the stalls. Also it seems more of a general market than for arts and crafts. It is quite difficult to navigate. \nAccess road and parking is an issue as road is bad and parking inadequate. \nOverall still worth the visit and you might be lucky to find odd interesting pieces. \n",

You walk through a food market first and then in a compound is where the real market is selling all local hand made items such as wood carvings, jewellery, cloths, paintings, artwork and many other items. You will have to haggle of course but i paid 6500n for a wood carving that was 15000n at the hotel. Bargain.",

You can order hand carved furniture, get a dress blinged with beads an buy ingredients for your dinner all in minutes.\n\nIt you need a relatively decent market setting at which to purchase you African souvenirs, this would be the place, so long as you're coming from Ikoyi or Victoria Island. I would think it would be quite out of the way for anyone coming from other locations. Its a must see place though. Parking is typical Lagos, always a crush when you find a space. What amazed me was finding fabric with designs from way back when I was a young 'un. :)\n\nExpats come to frequent this market to find those 'one-off' pieces for their homes.\n\nNice place to visit",

Look no further for such souvenirs.\nThere's something for everyone in terms of price. You could also have some customization done. Please only go with money you want to spend as you're likely to spend every cash as there's always something extra you would like to have.\nThe roads that lead to the market can be tricky in the raining season but once you arrive at the market you're fine.\nAlso make sure there is always an attend on ground and close by when you enter any shop or inspect any wares. There was one nasty but the other time with a foreigner (I won't mention country) and a trader who claimed some of his stones were missing. Same shop I was buying something from so I tried to intervene, thought I could settle the cost but alas one stone cost half of all the money I brought to the market. Very likely an isolated event but something to learn from.\nSo if you're in Lagos and want to purchase art or native memorabilia, etc, you know where to be.",

The market is a bit overwhelming at first and through it looks a little rough, I never felt unsafe. Had loads of fun looking around. I'm told the market does start closing up by 6 or so on week days (and the traffic is crazy by then anyway) so either go during the day or on the weekends. \n\nLOCATION NOTE: When I visited the TripAdvisor site (October 1, 2016) it displayed  a correct description of the market location but their map (and therefore navigation in the app if you use it) was completely wrong. Make sure to check Google maps for the correct location. \n\nHave fun",

Elmina Castle, erected by the Portuguese in 1482, was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, and the castle is the oldest European building in existence in the Sahara. Pay a visit to the Castle as well as the fishing harbour and market. If you like, walk up the hill to visit \tFort St Jago, offering wonderful panoramic views over the town.\nAs a tour guide working in Ghana, if you ask me, i will say, yes, Elmina Castle is the oldest castle having rich history on the slave trade but to have a real experience regarding the slave trade, you need to be at the Cape Coast Castle where the castle itself tells the story of what actually happened there regarding the slave trade,\na. The palaver hall where the slaves were sold and branded is bigger.\nb. The male dungeon which connect through a tunnel to the female dungeon and leading to the sea where boats wait to take the slaves to a land unknown to them against their will. The dungeon at the Cape Coast castle held hundreds or thousands at a time.\nc. The door of no return which is now known as a door of return is well structured for the human cargo to pass swiftly without much efforts into the waiting ships which carries the slaves away forever.",

We learned that once the slaves set foot in the castle, they could spend up to three months in horrific conditions. And that “The door of no return” was a portal through which the slaves were lowered into small boats and then loaded onto bigger ships further out to sea, never to set foot in their homeland again and with a final goodbye to the freedom they once knew.  Our kids are young, but were able to follow the guides teachings.\nOnly down side was the hawkers in the parking lot.  Very pushy, but not a reason not to go.  Just be prepared to say no if you are not interested.",

  "text": "This really is a must see attraction and a World Heritage site. Our guide was fantastic, tailoring our tour to suit the ages of the children in our group, aged 9 to 15.  It is a most excellent insight into the history of the castle, and what those poor people went through. \n\nI wish that some investment came with being a World Heritage site. It is a great place as it is, but you can see how it might be improved with just a little more funding. \n\nThe only downside was the hassle we received from the people outside the castle. I’ve been traveling to Ghana regularly for 20 years and this was definitely the worst I’ve experienced. \n\nThey seemed friendly at first, asking for our names. But there was a catch - they’d put our names onto shells (without asking) when we came out of the castle and asked for payment for having done this. When this wasn’t successful they wanted us to put our names and contact information on a piece of paper - which we didn’t do. They said it was to sponsor their football team which, of course, is fictional. They were overly persistent, even when told that we already support a football team and school in Ghana.  When this didn’t work they resorted to just asking for money. \n\nAnyway, don’t be put off from visiting. Just be aware that these people hang around and that these are their tricks! ",

His words around the last govenor of the prison, and the poem written about him as a \"god fearing, honorable man\" were resonant - simply to say that in a time of slavery, how this man was god fearing and honourable was, perhaps, something that only he could explain.\n\nThere are alot of people who could do with a visit here when they spout off about immigration, and their far right political views - this is exactly the sort of thing that could possibly put right some of the wrongs that still plague proportions of the western population.\n\nIt was a deeply moving experience, and while it isn't nice, if you're here you need to see it - in the same way as you need to see the holocaust experience. As uncomfortable as it is for a western white person, we need to cement in our minds that these appalling things must never happen again, and that the modern equivalents of the people who did this, and are trying to promote inequality (read Nigel Farage etc.) must be prevented from having a platform to try and return to this type of inhumane treatment and abuse.\n\nIt's a piece of history that everybody should understand and regret.",

It's a haunting, sad place, and a reminder how cruel humans can be to one another. Slaves were imprisoned in the harshest conditions, and many died here. Slaves that attempted to rebellion were thrown in a dungeon that was only opened when the last had died.\n\nIronically, there's a church in the centre of the castle.\n\nIn the room where hundreds of women were kept, there is still an acrid smell, hundreds of years after the last slaves were here. \n\nYou can hire a driver for $100 to $150 for the day in Accra, to take you to Elmina and the nearby Kakum National Park, where there's an amazing canopy tour. You'll pay about 40 Ghanaian Cedis for a 1-1.5 hour tour of the castle. \n\nWear comfortable walking shoes.",

  "text": "Appena entrati, presso la biglietteria iniziano i cartelli che intimano di non fotografare né all'interno del palazzo né nei cortili interni ma soltanto nel cortile principale (dove ci sono i negozi di souvenir). Ci sono degli armadietti dove depositare le macchine fotografiche. Non si capisce bene la logica di tale divieto, che è comunque sgradevole perché alcuni punti del palazzo sono molto fotogenici, in particolare le facciate con le nicchie con gli inserti scultorei e le porte di legno finemente intagliate. Il sito è protetto dall'Unesco, ma la manutenzione lascia molto a desiderare. Le nicchie con le sculture sono piene di ragnatele e i prati incolti. Bruttissimi i tetti di lamiera, che hanno l'unico pregio di riprendere vagamente il color rosso terracotta dei palazzi e delle mura. Alcuni palazzi ospitano il museo, i cui pezzi salienti sono, a mio avviso, gli scettri reali (ce n'è uno per ognuno dei re) e i troni. Il regno del Dahomey termina nell'anno 1900 con l'invasione francese.",

You learn a lot about the history of the castle, when it was built, what nations occupied it and when, and the slave trade of which the castle played a large part. The tour is guided and  very interesting! It is quite sobering to think of all the people that went through the \"door of no return\" on their way to serve as slaves in the new world. \nThe location is awesome as well, right on the shore of the gulf, with local fishermen's boats pulled up on the beach in front of the castle and many other boats docked or beached in the lagoon behind the castle. It is a feast for the senses! So much color, and the hustle bustle of the townspeople going about their daily routines. The smell of the lagoon and open sewer system can be a challenge to ignore, but if you can, visiting the castle is an enriching experience. I've visited twice since 2012, bringing groups both times, and I would certainly visit again. Been to Cape Coast Castle as well, but I must say, I like Elmina a little better.  ",

A banana seller is just right around the corner.\n\nThe guide was very knowledgeable and the fee paid included the guide. So there is no need to pay more. \n\nThe Osun festival happens around the 2nd or 3rd week of August and we were told that was the best time to visit. \n\nThe artworks were breathtaking and I asked the Osun goddess for triplets and loads of wealth. I hope she heard me. Lol.",

  "text": "Or perhaps I should clarify a little. It's a must-see for anyone with an interest in African history, art, culture and religion.\nThe ideal time to visit the grove would be at the culmination of the Osun Festival which holds annually in August. In addition to all that the grove has to offer, the August tourist will have the opportunity to take in a vibrant ceremony whose traditions date back a few hundred years. \nI have toured the grove unassisted in the past but during my recent visits, it's been made increasingly difficult to tour the site without engaging one of the official guides. Their fee is not exorbitant - I think I paid the equivalent of less than $20 for a 3-hour tour (you can spend more or less time depending on how much time you're willing and able to spend at each shrine or statue). \nI was puzzled by the security alert attached to this site by TripAdvisor. I've never heard of anyone's safety or security being compromised in the area. I was lugging a substantial bag of blatantly expensive photographic equipment and should have been an obvious target for miscreants. I remained constantly aware fo my surroundings as I always am in unfamiliar locations and never once sensed or saw a threat. \nThe forest and structures within the site would delight any photographer. The ubiquitous Mona Monkeys at the grove's entrance will entertain any nature -lover. Your own prior research or the help of a good guide will ensure that you appreciate the history and cultural significance of this place.",

  "text": "the whole Osogbo experience is very special particularly if you have affinity with local culture.  First, the sacred Grove is magical for two reasons. 1.  that it is still a functioning Shrine for the ancient Yoruba religion - for Osun the Water Goddess - is rare in a country when fundamental Christianity and Islam has destroyed much of the original Orisha and other local Nigerian religious sites.  2 that the outstanding and mystical art of Suzanne Wenger so clearly fraternises with the local environment that they both become as one.  Second, when you are in osogbo make sure you visit Suzanne's amazing house, Nike's gallery and art complex where students learn traditional cultural crafts such as Adire (traditional Yoruba batik).",

  "text": "The sacred grove was such a sight to see! The artwork was just incredible and the history surrounding it is very interesting. Luckily my fiancee and I were visiting a friend who lives in Ile Ife, and had him as our escort and guide, which made things much easier. To be honest doing anything sans a friend who is a local or native is basically impossible, unless you know the culture and are a seasoned traveler. However the people of Osogbo were very nice and welcoming, if not a bit wary or curious as to our presence as foreigners. My fiancee and I wanted to learn as in depth as we could about the Ifa religion and thanks to our friends and his acquaintances we were able to. \n\nI lived in Nigeria for over 2 years (In Yola, Adamawa) and my time in Ife/Osogbo and the surrounding areas was the most enjoyable time I had in those two years. I love the Yoruba people, they are kind and warm people and probobly the most sincere you will find in Nigeria. \n\nThis is a place many people will never see and it really is a damn shame, because this part of Nigeria is steeped in history, tradition, and beauty. Love love love the Osun Grove!",

Se hace una procesión desde el templo de Osun hasta el río, ahí se pueden ver los bailes y la música tradicionales y los ritos a Osun, la deidad del rio. La gente es muy amable. Las personas que tocan los tambores les querrán tocar a cambio de dinero como aportación voluntaria, ya es de cada quien si aceptan o no. También hay adivinaciones de los sacerdotes y sacerdotisas. Es un ambiente muy agradable, hay visitantes tanto locales como extranjeros (asiáticos, europeos, americanos, latinoamericanos). También hay mucha seguridad, hay muchos policías ese día porque al evento va el rey de Osogbo. Hay muchas actividades por hacer, muchas cosas qué ver y mucha gente qué conocer. Yo sí les recomiendo la visita.",

Only buy precious stones if you are an expert and can differentiate real from fake. Feel free to negotiate hard and strike a reasonable bargain, sometimes 50% or more. Avoid going there on a rainy day. Best time is after and before office rush hours. Sunday the market is closed though some shops are still open. Good for couples or grown ups for young kids nothing much interesting. A must visit even if you don't want to shop!",

The traditional glass beadworks are exceptional and well worth investing in. Haggle hard, but with good humour and you'll come away with great bargains. Good for good quality herbs and vegetables that may not be in the main food shops, and popular with many expatriate communities. Watch out for flooding in rainy season or take your wellies.",

  "text": "The royal palaces of the Dahomey kingdom are spread all around the town of Abomey.\n\nWe are traveling around West Africa with a Togolese English-speaking guide. He suggested we begin our tour of the kings palaces with a visit to one palace that also houses the main museum. \n\nWe didn't visit a second palace. \n\nOur visit to the palace was underwhelming. Yes it was interesting to see the architecture and a few of the items showcased in the museum, however the museum collection is spread all over the complex in small, dark rooms in locked buildings. \n\nA map of the complex is not available aside from a heavily weathered, to the point of being unreadable, plaque when you first enter. \n\nWe were provided with a museum staff member who was supposed to be our guide, but he did essentially no guiding and just followed us around. I refuse to call him a guide. \n\nWe wandered around the complex with our Togolese guide doing his best to recall what he'd learned on previous visits to the museum. \n\nWe had to wait for our museum staff member to unlock every building before we could enter. \n\nYou aren't allowed to take pictures for some reason and our unlocking staff member did double duty as our photo policeman. \n\nIn my opinion, tourism works as follows: a tourist visits somewhere, takes photos, shares photos and the experience with others and inspires them visit as well....\n\nDon't waste your time travelling all the way to Abomey to visit here.

  "text": "Yes it is true, some of the palaces are not well preserved and not being taken care of. UNESCO efforts to restore and protect have been burned down several times \"accidentally\" by children igniting the grass around the structures to catch bushmeat. But a lot of archeological sites in the world have not a lot to see any more. The history behind those palaces is really fascinating and you can get a very good feel of the sites if you take some time and walk around the premises of the ruins. Locked front gates should not prevent you from it, everybody walks around them. The guide we hired from the tourist office was very helpful though not knowledgeable to an academical level naturally. We liked him anyhow and hired him next day to show us markets, places to eat and the museum. Official rate is CFA 4.000 for two hours plus 2.000 for the tourist office. Later one you can save if you hire him directly. We strongly recommend a guide, they are helpful, not expensive and you do a good job in directly supporting the young people there. Our official guide from the tourist center was the only English speaking one, we where his second customers this year in October.",

  "text": "Visiting Nike Art Gallery with my friends Oluchi and Uche was such a refreshing and inspiring experience. From the moment we arrived, the space felt extremely neat, welcoming, and full of creative energy. Timothy showed us around and did a fantastic job explaining the different art pieces, which made the experience even more meaningful. We went upstairs and were amazed by the variety—vivid, colourful artworks, and fascinating pieces made entirely from trash. Each artwork told a story. Outside the gallery, the vibe continued with drummers and dancers performing live, adding a lively cultural touch. We had so much fun and left feeling inspired. I highly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates art in all its forms.",

  "text": "Of the several fortified trading posts along the coast of Ghana, which today belong to the UNESCO World Heritage, only the three biggest ones are called castles: Christiansborg of mainly Danish origin in Osu, Accra (not open to the public, since it gets used by the government), Cape Coast (mainly British in its today construction) and St.George in Elmina, which is mainly Dutch in character.\n\nThe castles of Cape Coast and Elmina are now museums and they are by far the best preserved (and restored) and also the most visited of all these heritage sites. On top they are only about 13 km apart from each other. If in the area, it definitely makes sense to visit them both.\n\nThe castle at Elmina was first built by the Portuguese in 1482, thus 10 years before Columbus had reached the America's. The main reason was to trade in gold, which apparently was abundant here at the 'Gold Coast' (as the old colonial name of Ghana went). In 1637 the castle became Dutch until 1872, when all their properties here were sold to the British. \n\nIn its structure the castle is still mainly a work of the Dutch and there are inscriptions in Dutch language to be seen at different points. From the Portuguese times only the chapel in the courtyard is left, which the Dutch turned into a warehouse and where now a very worthwhile exhibition with photographs and comments about Elmina's past can be seen - with themes like 'Trade, Slave Trade, Religion. Traditional Building, or the Asante in Elmina'.\n\nUnlike at the much more visited Cape Coast Castle, one gets pestered here, when approaching the castle, by a whole bunch of youngsters, who all want to shake hands with you, then get into some kind of business, trying to sell you something, offering guiding services ot asking for supoort for their local soccer club.\n\nAt the castle gate I had to pay 40 GHS, thus the same entrance fee is at Cape Coast, only here I was not given a ticket. An aggressive, unpleasant looking official guide wanted to offer me his guiding services, but since - unlike Cape Coast - they are not compulsory, I declined and was quite happy to visit the place all by myself.\n\nBesides the exhibition there are several empty rooms to be seen, but also the dungeons for the slaves. From the parapet are great views towards the beach, the lagoon, Fort St.Jago on an opposite hill and the fishing harbour. The architecture of St:George castle, as it was called by the British, is quite impressive, almost more so than at Cape Coast.",

Elmina ist grösser und „schöner“, wobei wir in Cape Coast einen deutlich engagierten Guide hatten und uns das Schicksal der Sklaven dort stärker berührt hatten. Hier war der Guide sehr lustlos und sein Englisch schwer verständlich. \nNach der Besichtigung lohnt sich noch ein Blick in den Innenhof hinten mit einigen Souvenirläden. \nBei den Jungs auf dem Parkplatz fiel uns Peter Cobbina auf, er ist sehr engagiert, interessant im Gespräch und hat uns eine schöne Führung durch Elmina gegeben.  +233556282740, P.O.

  "text": "Like Cape Coast (well worth a visit), Elmina tells the story of slavery in Ghana - it's a grim tale of men and women at their best and worst, of greed, suffering, rape, exploitation and hope. People throughout the world can trace their roots back here and for many it must be a pilgrimage to come; for tourists like myself, it is a lesson and a warning lest anything like this should ever happen again. Get a guide to take you round if you can - it's difficult to understand the experience here without one - the spaces will mean little without knowledge of their true function as - for example - a parade ground for officers to choose slave women for their beds. For many, this is a shrine and so it's essential to have regard for the sanctity of the place. Thoroughly recommend - a must-do for us all.",

  "text": "This is rated to be the oldest European site in West Africa, established by the Portuguese in the late 15th century. Taken over by the Dutch and then the British, it was a major trading post for centuries, first gold, then slaves. The dungeons are chilling, as are the stories told by the guide. Your guided tour of the castle is part of the entrance fee. \n\nThe building itself is attractive, with many stories, rooms and ramparts, with broad views along the coast and down to the beach and harbour. This is a significant world heritage site, well worth visiting if you are in Ghana. These are several shops inside with fixed prices and good value.",

There are cool art gift shops throughout the castle, and these are places you are not pressured to buy (unlike many other tourist areas!). However, when entering and exiting the castle, beware of people trying to sell bracelets and get you to 'sponsor their soccer team or school'. They are persistent, which is frustrating.",

  "text": "Ghana is the land of the European forts and castles, as there are more of these trans-atlantic chattel slavery and colonial edifices in Ghana than any other African country by a country mile. \n\nThere are several forts built to protect Europeans and their wares all over the coast of Ghana, but there are only three castles that remain till date: Elmina, Cape Coast and Chrisitianborg or Osu. \n\nThe Elmina and Cape Coast Castles played significant roles during the slave trade. The Portuguese, especially, traded over eleven Africans from across the Westerh Africa region, while the British traded over four million Africans from all over West Africa respectively to the Americas  during the duration of the slave trade.\n\nIt is therefore always a form of soul cleansing to visit these two castles and as said by someone, \"no African should live through life without visiting the slave castles in Ghana\". The Cape Coast Castle for example shows how the Europeans lived and did business with the locals and their ilk and sometimes how wicked they were towards their fellow human beings. \n\nI implore all who can to visit the Cape Coast or Elmina Castles to learn some of the sordid things done to the black race by  a race that thought it was superior.",

The general rule of thumb is that you should get your selected item at 50% of the quoted price (if not less!!). This is the place to explore and look around. You'll find some amazing stuff here!!",

You must know how to bargain as prices tend to be highly over stated. Rule of thumb is to cut it down by 50% and maintain your stand know matter how much you want it. you can go lower too.never stop at a shop. go around the market to see other items you may just getter better stuffs. Do not try to visit this market whenever it rains.It will be like crossing the biblical red se.a. Try to get a little model of the old Lagos Danfo and other interesting artifacts. Just don't forget to ensure you head to the Lagos Museum to register the artifacts and get your export permit",

My discovery was slowed down by the crazy heat (Sun), It was really crazy but I eventually got cool accessories.\n\nThese are the kind of things I found when I went to ghana. The market was filled with a lot of handmade accessories from beads, to fresh water pearls, leather skins, it was almost unbelievable. \n\nI said to my friend that Nigerians are so super creative with the artifacts in the market. \n\nThe market is not your typical market but more modern like you will find in other countries, if you understand art and are looking for different unique craft items this is the market to go. \n\nThey make a lot of the art and crafts there e.g butterfly skin paintings (I probably touched more animals in the market than I have ever done in my life). So, they use animal skins for some of the deco’s (Butterfly, Zebra, snake and more). \n\nI barely spent the 5,000 from the market but I only got 2 items for N2,500 (A vintage purse I adore for N1,900 and N600 for the necklace).\n\nFor accessories the market is really affordable. Advice for local's is don't be deceived by the prices they tell you, still go hard on negotiating and the sellers don't like that.",

  "text": "Elmina castle was constructed by the Portuguese who wished to pursue their interests in gold and the promulgation of their faith. Somehow (!!!) they ended up trading in human flesh as part of The transatlantic slave trade. There are old artefacts that remain at the castle and a visit is a must for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of the trade and the African diaspora. I travelled with a party of adults and teens to take a tour of the dungeons where human beings were chained oftentimes in close proximity to the slavers’ places of worship. It’s a moving, educational experience. But, and this is a drawback that MUST be fixed, our guide did not speak clearly. He was muffled or too softly spoken, too fast and wouldn’t stop to make sure we’d understood. One member of my party heard nothing but a few dates rattled out so quickly they made no sense to him. What a missed opportunity!! Elmina Castle, please fix this!! Everyone else: please visit. ",

The stories told are shocking and humbling - and should hopefully serve to make us better embrace the value of universal human rights and react against today's modern forms of slavery. \n\nWhile the international context and drivers behind the slave trade are aspects relatively well covered by the guides, attention should also be given to the local circumstances under which the trade prospered - that is, also reflecting the local rulers' role in the slave trade. This is not a pledge to be \"fair\" in describing this horrible history - but rather to leave \"political correctness\" and focus on the factual power relations instead. Only then may this horrendous chapter learn us something.\n\n",

Joined a small group of tourists & the young male tour guide was very informative explaining about the history of the Castle going back a few hundred years, shown around different parts of the Castle & reflecting on the terrible past of the prisoners. The guided tour last approximately one hour & you were then free to look around at your own pace taking many beautiful pics especially along the coastline & the historical architectural structure, a very interesting insight about the past & continuous restoration work on-going to maintain the structure for the next generation. A couple of Souvenir shops to browse around with an excellent selection choice of Ghanian postcards & gifts. I highly recommend a visit to the Castle while visiting Ghana.",

You can have a guide and have the history explained to you but that is easy to find or already well known otherwise why are you here? Suffice to say that this predates the more frequently visited Cape Coast castle by around 150 years but shares the common theme of its primary use. Well worth a visit in a easy photographic location. There are the usual scams tried outside where they'll ask your name so it will be on a bracelet when you come out and try to make you feel guilty to buy it or 'sponsor their school'.

  "text": "Elmina started life as a coastal store house for the early 15th century Portuguese traders in West Africa. It was so  named because of the nearby inland mines. Once the Portuguese traders, in return for their goods, started to accept captured slaves as a form of currency from local warrior chieftains, the store rooms of Elmina  began to be used for holding slaves.  Elmina is small compared to some of the other coastal slave forts but still exudes an immense feeling of pathos as the visitor passes through the same hellish rooms in which hundreds of men, women and children were incarcerated for before their trans-Atlantic crossing. The castle possesses an original \"door of no return\" through which the slaves would have to pass through onto the boats.",

To see one of the many doors of no return and to learn how the slaves were treated below the church service, was depressing. However, it's an important part of history and the guide's words at the end were thoughtful when he encouraged all of us who had been angered by the inhumane treatment of those who passed through the fort's gates, to not become the thing we hate. So in that way, I think this is a must do.",

The guide was knowledgeable and helped make sense of the restored monuments. There is essentially nothing original, the walls and buildings were rebuilt around 2007 and since then nothing has been done. The buildings are decaying, the signs are rusting and becoming illegible. \nThe museum is worth visiting separately, it gives some more information on the Abomey Kingdom. Entry is 3 euro. Our guide was OK but more interested in completing the tour than imparting understanding of the Kindgoms.\nOne day is enough for Abomey.",

Although slavery has been abolished, my perspective is that it just changed names and we call it now : human trafficking. I wish they would touch on that a little, but I guess that would not be too popular with the tourists!\nAll the same, a beautiful coast line, I don’t regret any moment of this sight!",

Please dress very simple,no jewellery on you (that immediately will shout you are a \"fresh fish\" and the price will jump to sky), don't show you have money, arrange small notes in different pocket,have hat&water,sunblock on you. If you see your piece,prepare to bargain. Usually 3 times less the price they ask. Remember,bargain is a must. Even if the seller is not agree,don't be disappointed,just walk away and believe me,they'll run after you. Better is to go with somebody who knows the place-friend,driver,local or resident with experience ......Thirsday mornings usually is sanitations(cleaning time)for markets,so will not be open till noon. Saturday is full with expats,if this will make you to fill better. People are friendly,if you smile,but I'll not go there alone for sample.",

It's not well marked, our local driver had to ask several times for where it was located.  When w did arrive I didn't believe it and walked into the area before it changed to art.  It's worth the trip not only do you get some local color, but the art is quite good and many of the stall are populated by the artist.  I saw some of the reviews complain about the hard sell.  Well we didn't experience any of that and I've gone to most artisan markets in the region of West Africa.  This one was quite laid back in comparison.  there are local young adults when you walk in that will try to attach themselves to you. Either ignore, or as we did pick one and if they know what your looking for will take you to specific stalls.  The place is not small so allow yourself some time, and barter you'll be surprised hoe inexpensive things are.  We got some excellent masks and had a good time interacting with the artisans.  Felt very safe.",

  "title": "An overview of a day in Mindelo as a cruise port",

  "text": "We have been to Mindelo twice now, both as a one day port of call whilst on a cruise. We have had a pleasant time on both occasions, though if you are seeking glamour and modern shopping centres this is not the port for you. If however you like to explore every port and seek out what it has to offer, you can certainly enjoy your time here. The scope of the excursions offered from the ship (or rather the lack of) give a good indication of what you might expect here.\n\nIt is a short walk along the port road, though a minibus shuttle has been offered each time we have visited.As you walk along the coast road you will see fishermen and as you reach the town, they will be gutting and selling fish on the beach. It is a very laid back place and understand that unemployment is extremely high and so many people 'hanging around'.\n\nStill on the waters edge you will find a small fishing museum 'Museu do Mar' (based on the style of the Belem Tower in Lisbon) which is certainly worth a look and then next along is the fish market, which can be interesting to see what different countries have on offer.  There isn't really anything if you continue on further, but if you now head inland you will find the market square, which has a differing number of stalls depending on the day. You will see many beautiful blue and white art tiles, also as seen in Portugal.\n\n If you now take the street parallel to the coast road, you will find a rather nice gallery/craft shop and also the church. Onward and then to the right you will find an indoor market (can't quite remember but it may be the old town hall) and also see the beautiful colonial architecture of the pink palace, Palacio do Povo (Peoples palace). The University is located behind this, accessed to the right as you look at the Palace.\n\nBack down to the harbour and you will find the cultural centre - a small affair but easy to walk into, friendly staff, local music playing (CD not live) and some interesting artwork on display (though it does change so may just depend how you catch it). They also sell stamps so you can send your postcards much cheaper than on ship.\n\nBack on the waters edge where the shuttle bus departs is a tourist centre, which offers a very pleasant stop for a beverage! Our first visit was at the weekend and a local performing group entertained us for a hour or so, but our subsequent visit was a weekday and this did not occur. We enjoyed a very pleasant lunch. The wind breaks were much appreciated on the breezy and cool January day, which was quite a contrast from the blazing hot sun we experienced thee previous time in April.\nSome fellow passengers felt ill at ease here and if looking at the photographs this may apply to you, perhaps consider booking one of the ships excursions so that at least you see a little of the island.",

I bought all my gifts for my friends in this store as, on top of it, the staff is very useful, nice and knowledgeable. Definitely the place to come to in Mindelo for all your gifts!",

It's unique and a must have and must visit !!!\nUpstairs are products for the home but it's worth looking at the unique lampshades etc. Notice the vases on the steps. Sorry, no elevator.\n\nRemember this store is closed during lunch hours.\n\nAlso, try to find the Alternativa Galeria on Av. 5 de Julho, M(+238) 994-88-92\n\nIt's behind the famous PINK building at the circle and it's the YELLOW building. \nLunch is available, at reasonable prices and among the great local art.\n\nI love to support and shop at Artesian stores and this maybe the store for you.\n\nEnjoy your stay in Mindelo, Cabo Verde",

But the fact that you're not allowed to take pictures inside is little bit too harsh, and since this is about only attraction you will see in Abomey, and considering it takes such long time to get to Abomey from usual big cities down south, I don't know if it's worth the trip. If you're inevitably passing by the region, or if you're really interested in histories, then sure it's good to go. But I wouldn't say it's a must visit site if you have limited time in Benin. The town itself is interesting in many ways, it's just not that photogenic except for the old symbols on the palaces of Dahomey.",

Vous n'y verrez que des batiment de terre, quelques \"tombes royales\" et quelques objets de la vie quotidienne que vous aurez déjà vus dans d'autres musées, voir encore mieux dans les villages locaux.\n\nL'accueil dans ce lieu a été en ce qui nous concerne vraiment détestable : il nous a fallu attendre un bout de temps que quelqu'un vienne, qui n'avait visiblement pas envie de faire de visite. Ma visite a été expédiée en quelques 30 minutes (remarquez plus, pourquoi faire ?) et à noter pour nos amis photographes : il est rigoureusement interdit de prendre des photos à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur !!! Pour des raisons de respect bien entendu sachant que des cartes postales sont en vente à la sortie....\n\nBref, visite sans grand intérêt, pas très agréable. Il y a beaucoup d'autres endroits à voir au Bénin, bien plus agréables. C'est en ce qui nous concerne le seul endroit où nous n'avons pas eu le sentiment d'être bienvenus dans ce magnifique pays qu'est le Bénin. passez votre chemin !",

Abomey est le siège de la lignée de ce roi glorieux et de tous ses prédécesseurs. L'ensemble des palais royaux d'Abomey et son musée, sont inscrits au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 1985. Plusieurs palais dans un même ensemble permettent de connaître les coutumes des sujets du royaume du Dahomey, de découvrir de nombreuses salles, cours et tombeaux, avec des collections de trônes royaux et de récades (sceptres royaux) en bois sculpté. La visite sous la conduite d'un guide -indispensable- est vraiment passionnante pour comprendre l'histoire longue du pays avant qu'il ne devienne à la fin du XIXème siècle une colonie française. Autour du palais une cité des artisans présente également un grand intérêt avec en particulier des tisserands.",

The history of the kings from past to present is included and the exhibits are good and fully show the cruel history of slavery and human sacrifice.   The sight is a Unesco Heritage site but you are not allowed to take photos inside which really annoys me personally. The craft market inside the gate is the best I have seen in Togo and Benin combined.  That said, the road to get here is a disgrace and we have been on some awful roads in this part of world.  It took 5.5 hours to get from Cotonou and the distance is approx 85 miles.\n\nAlso the hotels in this area are very low quality.   It is impossible to just go for the day and visit the site so my advice is to wait until Unesco can get the road fixed before you consider going.",

  "text": "So if you are lucky enough to have found yourself in Benin, The Royal Palace of Abomey is definitely worth the visit.  This complex of historical palaces traces the history of the Dahomey empire, ancient ancestors of Danzig (little known fact).  The walls of this place are painted in blood and lined with animal bones. There is a mural depicting a wide variety of punishments and tortures, my personal favorite being the clay flute which was shoved up \"somebody's bum\", as it was translated to us.  Oh, and yeah, there is a THRONE OF SKULLS.  An actual throne, resting on a bed of skulls. Metal.\nAlso, FYI, it is a very short distance from the taxi park to the museum, probably even walkable, so don't let zemijohns overcharge for the trip.",

Parken Sie weiter unten, zahlen Sie an die omnipräsenten, selbsternannten Parkwächter einen kleinen Obulus (5,00 Cedi).\nDer Besuch der Festung führt Sie in die Zellen der dort in Gewahrsam gehaltenen Sklaven, die Empfangsräume des Gouverneurs, die Schlafräume, die Kapelle. Man mag sich nicht ausmalen, wie es damals hier zuging. Allein die Vorstellung der olfaktorischen und sanitären Sensation ist grauenerregend.\nDer Besuch der Festung kann nur jedem Reisenden auf das Wärmste empfohlen werden!",

Well, it was because my wife had toothache and yes, she was able to buy some local Grogg here and it did help her tooth!\n\nTheir mission is definitely \"no plastics\" and the sustainable gifts come in all shapes and sizes, with not a sign of plastic, mainly made by female entrepreneurs.\n\nWe spoke to Elsa on 18 January 2023, who explained that all products and gifts are locally sourced and made in Cape Verde. So they really are pushing a number of the UN SDGs like \n*Nr 5: Gender Equality, \n*Nr 8: Decent work and economic growth, \n*Nr 11: Sustainable cities and communities\n\nWould be a great place to educate your kids (and adults) about these important sustainable goals.",

Una volta entrati non abbiamo potuto non apprezzare il grazioso artigianato esposto nonché il meritevole concetto che lo anima. A ciò si aggiunge la gentilezza delle ragazze del negozio, molto disponibili, attente e sempre sorridenti. Il nostro consiglio è quello di acquistare i vostri souvenir da Djunta Mo Art: ad un prezzo onesto, potrete acquistare pensierini autentici e che fanno del bene alla comunità capoverdiana. E sono talmente belli che non potranno non essere apprezzati da chi li riceverà. In vendita a un costo simbolico troverete anche un libro di suggestivi scatti fotografici dell'Isola di Sal il cui ricavato andrà a sostegno dell'associazione Nu Bai.\nChe dire, buono shopping 100% capoverdiano!",

The service was incredible, the communication very good, the packaging and delivery swift, and the final product exceeded all of my expectations. I was charmed that the bag with the product was drawn by hand in beautiful script. I ordered online via Facebook chat and paid via paypal. Very easy process. I was even given some photos of the beautiful women artisans who create the \"pano de tera\" from Gouveia close to Cidade Velha (Santiago Island) So grateful for this treasure which draws me close to the story of a great grandfather who was from Cape Verde, and married my Hawaiian great grandmother. So precious. I look forward to doing business again here. Simply stunning work. So so so grateful!",
