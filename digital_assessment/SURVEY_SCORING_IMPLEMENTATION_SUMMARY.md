# Survey Scoring Implementation Summary
**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Survey Assessment** scoring system (0-30 points) to complement the existing **External Assessment** (0-70 points), creating a dual-scoring framework where:
- **External Assessment (70 pts)**: What we observe from outside (website, social media, reviews)
- **Survey Assessment (30 pts)**: Internal capacity (skills, knowledge, resources, readiness)
- **Combined Total**: 100 points

---

## üìã What Was Accomplished

### 1. ‚úÖ Scoring Framework Created
- **Location**: `docs/SURVEY_SCORING_FRAMEWORK.md`
- **Structure**: 3 sections, 10 points each
  - **Digital Foundation** (10 pts): Current digital presence
  - **Digital Capability** (10 pts): Skills and infrastructure
  - **Growth Readiness** (10 pts): Knowledge and investment capacity

### 2. ‚úÖ Scoring Reference Guide
- **Location**: `docs/SURVEY_SCORING_REFERENCE.md`
- **Purpose**: Quick reference for scoring future surveys
- **Contents**: Detailed scoring rules for each question, examples, quality checks

### 3. ‚úÖ Question Mapping
- **Location**: `survey_question_mapping.py`
- **Purpose**: Maps actual Google Sheet column names to scoring framework
- **Supports**: Both CI_Survey and TO_Survey with different question numbers

### 4. ‚úÖ Automated Scorer
- **Location**: `survey_capacity_scorer.py`
- **Features**:
  - Reads survey responses and applies scoring rules
  - Intelligent bonus logic (e.g., weekly posting = content creation credit)
  - Aligned tier classifications

### 5. ‚úÖ Score Matching System
- **Location**: `score_and_match_surveys.py`
- **Features**:
  - Fuzzy matching to pair survey responses with assessment participants
  - 100% match rate achieved (7/7 responses matched)
  - Detailed reporting with confidence scores

### 6. ‚úÖ Spreadsheet Integration
- **Location**: `update_survey_scores_in_sheet.py`
- **Features**:
  - Auto-creates new columns in Google Sheets if needed
  - Writes survey scores separate from external assessment
  - Columns added:
    - Survey Total (0-30)
    - Survey Foundation (0-10)
    - Survey Capability (0-10)
    - Survey Growth (0-10)
    - Survey Tier
    - Survey Date

## üìä Key Scoring Updates

### Initial Weights (Version 1.0)
Foundation:
- Website: 2 pts
- Social Platforms: 2 pts
- Posting Frequency: 2 pts
- Online Sales: 2 pts
- Reviews: 2 pts

### Updated Weights (Version 2.0) - Based on User Feedback
Foundation:
- Website: 2 pts (unchanged)
- Social Platforms: **3 pts** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (increased to reflect multi-platform effort)
- Posting Frequency: 2 pts (unchanged)
- Online Sales: **1 pt** ‚¨áÔ∏è (reduced - nice to have, not essential)
- Reviews: 2 pts (unchanged)

**Key Logic Addition**:
- **Content Creation Bonus**: If posting Weekly ‚Üí auto-gets 1.5/2.0 on content creation
- **Rationale**: You can't post regularly without creating content!

## üèÜ Tier Classification Alignment

### Aligned with External Assessment (30 pts = 100%)

| Points | Percentage | Tier | Count |
|--------|------------|------|-------|
| 25-30 | 81-100% | **Expert** | 0 |
| 19-24 | 61-80% | **Advanced** | 1 (Abuko Pottery) |
| 13-18 | 41-60% | **Intermediate** | 6 (all others) |
| 7-12 | 21-40% | **Emerging** | 0 |
| 0-6 | 0-20% | **Absent/Basic** | 0 |

This perfectly matches the external assessment tier system!

## üîç Example: Flex Fuzion Detailed Breakdown

**Total: 17.0/30 (57%) - Intermediate**

## üéØ Next Steps for Dashboard Integration

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Survey scores are in the Google Sheet
- ‚úÖ Separate columns for External and Survey assessments
- ‚úÖ Aligned tier classifications

### For Dashboard Display
The backend (Firebase Functions in `functions/src/app.ts`) needs to:

1. **Read the new survey columns** from the sheet:
   - Survey Total (0-30)
   - Survey Foundation (0-10)
   - Survey Capability (0-10)
   - Survey Growth (0-10)
   - Survey Tier

2. **Update `mapRowToAssessment` function** to include survey scores

3. **Dashboard UI updates needed**:
   - Show External Assessment (0-70) separately
   - Show Survey Assessment (0-30) separately
   - Display combined maturity tier
   - Charts showing external vs survey scores
   - Filtering by participants with survey data

### Backend Column Indices (to be confirmed)
Based on the sheet structure, the survey columns are likely at:
- **CI Assessment**: Columns 40-45
- **TO Assessment**: Columns 38-43

## üìä Scoring Philosophy

### What Makes This System Effective

1. **Dual Perspective**:
   - External: What others see
   - Survey: Internal capability
   - Combined: Complete picture

2. **Reveals Gaps**:
   - High External + Low Survey = Sustainability risk (outsourcing/single person)
   - Low External + High Survey = Untapped potential
   - Low External + Low Survey = Need comprehensive support

3. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Scores tied to specific questions
   - Clear tier definitions
   - Practical recommendations per tier

4. **Realistic Weighting**:
   - Social platforms valued highly (3 pts) - reflects effort
   - Online sales less critical (1 pt) - not essential for beginners
   - Content creation bonus - recognizes posting = creating

5. **Aligned Classification**:
   - Same 5 tiers as external assessment
   - Consistent language across both systems
   - Easy comparison and reporting

---

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Question mapping is crucial** - Survey questions had different numbers than expected
2. **Posting frequency implies content creation** - Important insight that improved scoring
3. **Multi-platform presence deserves more weight** - Managing 4+ platforms is significant effort
4. **Tier alignment matters** - Consistency across assessment types improves communication
5. **Fuzzy matching works** - 100% match rate with name normalization

## üìû For Future Surveys

When new survey responses come in:

1. Run: `python score_and_match_surveys.py`
   - Scores all responses
   - Matches to participants
   - Generates JSON report

2. Review the match report for confidence scores
   - HIGH (85%+): Auto-accept
   - MEDIUM (65-84%): Review suggested match
   - LOW (<65%): Manual matching required

3. Run: `python update_survey_scores_in_sheet.py`
   - Updates Google Sheet with new scores
   - Preserves existing data

4. Scores automatically flow to dashboard (once backend updated)
