# Digital Capacity Survey: Initial Findings Report
**Period**: September-October 2025  
**Responses**: 7 participants (5 Creative Industries, 2 Tour Operators)  
**Response Rate**: 8% of total participants (7 of ~85)

---

## Executive Summary

While still an early sample, the initial survey responses reveal a consistent pattern of **digital aspiration hindered by resource constraints**. All seven respondents demonstrate active digital engagement—managing multiple social media platforms and creating their own content—yet score in the Intermediate range (50-60% capacity), indicating significant room for growth. The gap between their digital activity and strategic capacity presents a clear opportunity for targeted skill-building interventions.

## Quantitative Findings

### Overall Capacity Scores (out of 30 points possible)

| Participant | Score | Percentage | Tier |
|-------------|-------|------------|------|
| Abuko Pottery Centre | 20.25 | 68% | **Advanced** |
| Bushwhacker Tours | 18.0 | 60% | Intermediate |
| Ebunjan Theatre | 17.75 | 59% | Intermediate |
| Yaws Creations | 17.5 | 58% | Intermediate |
| Flex Fuzion | 17.0 | 57% | Intermediate |
| Galloya Street Arts | 17.0 | 57% | Intermediate |
| Eco Tours | 15.0 | 50% | Intermediate |
| **Average** | **17.5** | **58%** | **Intermediate** |

**Key Finding**: The tight clustering (15.0-20.25) indicates relatively homogeneous digital capacity across respondents, with only Abuko Pottery Centre breaking into the Advanced tier.

### Capacity Breakdown by Domain

**Digital Foundation** (Current Presence): 5.0-8.3/10
- All respondents are active on 3-4 social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp Business most common)
- Most post weekly or more frequently
- However, only 2 have websites, and none have robust e-commerce
- Review presence is limited (typically 1 platform only)

**Digital Capability** (Skills & Infrastructure): 6.0-8.5/10
- **Strength**: All seven report being "very comfortable" or "somewhat comfortable" with digital tools
- **Critical Gap**: 5 of 7 rely on smartphones only (no computer/laptop access)
- **Connectivity**: Internet is "usually reliable" but with occasional issues
- **Analytics**: Most express interest in learning to track metrics but don't currently do so

**Growth Readiness** (Investment & Knowledge): 2.75-5.25/10
- **Low financial investment**: Most don't track digital spending or invest minimally
- **No formal training**: Zero participants have received formal digital marketing training
- **High knowledge awareness**: All recognize 5+ components of digital marketing
- **Content creation paradox**: Despite posting regularly, several said they "don't create promotional content"

---

## Common Themes & Patterns

### 1. **The "Busy Digital Practitioner" Phenomenon**

Every respondent manages multiple digital platforms and posts regularly, yet scores suggest they lack strategic direction. As one tour operator noted, their biggest challenge is "*Don't know how to use digital tools*" despite being active on 5+ platforms. This apparent contradiction reveals a pattern of **activity without strategy**—they're doing digital marketing by necessity but without training or framework.

**Quote Context**: Both tour operators cited "Don't know how to use digital tools" as their primary challenge, yet both manage websites, create content (photos, videos, written descriptions), and maintain social media presences. What they likely mean is they don't know how to use tools *strategically* or *measure effectiveness*.

### 2. **The Cost Barrier Paradox**

Four respondents identified cost as their primary digital challenge—either "*Too expensive (internet, phone data, etc.)*" or "*No staff to handle digital marketing*"—yet when asked about investment:
- Most indicated they could invest D1,000-15,000 annually in digital improvement
- All expressed strong interest in group training ("Yes, definitely" or "Yes, if it's affordable")
- Multiple respondents already hire photographers/videographers for content

This suggests the issue isn't inability to invest, but **uncertainty about where to invest effectively**. They need guidance on cost-effective digital strategies that deliver measurable returns.

### 3. **Language as a Hidden Barrier**

Two respondents (Ebunjan Theatre and Abuko Pottery Centre) cited "*Language barriers (most content is in English)*" as their biggest digital challenge. This is significant given:
- Both are performing/visual arts organizations serving local and international audiences
- Both want to attract diaspora and regional West African visitors
- Content creation in local languages could be a differentiator

**Implication**: Training programs should explicitly address multilingual content strategies and tools for creating content in Wolof, Mandinka, and other local languages.

### 4. **The Multi-Platform Juggle**

Respondents are remarkably active across platforms:
- **Flex Fuzion** manages 6 platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp Business, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter/X)
- **Bushwhacker Tours** sells through 3 channels (own website, social media, Viator)
- Most maintain 4+ social platforms simultaneously

Yet several identified "*Don't have time*" or "*No staff*" as challenges. This indicates **platform overextension**—spreading efforts too thin rather than focusing strategically. Training should include guidance on platform prioritization based on target audiences.

### 5. **Strong Local-International Bridge**

All respondents serve both local Gambians and international tourists, creating complex marketing needs:
- **Galloya Street Arts**: Sells at local markets AND reaches tourists through tour operators and online discovery
- **Yaws Creations**: Serves local customers through markets while also managing international partnerships and e-commerce
- **Eco Tours**: Partners with hotels locally while attracting direct bookings from North American and European tourists online

This dual audience requires **sophisticated segmentation strategies** that current digital capacity doesn't support.

## What Respondents Are Asking For

### Training Needs (Mentioned by 6-7 of 7 respondents)
1. **Digital marketing training** - Universal desire
2. **Better website** - 6 of 7 want improved web presence
3. **Professional photos/videos** - Recognition that content quality matters
4. **More social media followers** - Understanding that reach = revenue
5. **Online payment systems** - E-commerce readiness

### Priority Ranking (Tour Operators)

Both tour operators provided detailed priority lists:

**Eco Tours' Top Priorities:**
1. Better website
2. More social media followers  
3. Professional business photos/videos
4. Online payment system
5. Training on digital marketing

**Bushwhacker Tours' Top Priorities:**
1. Online payment system
2. Online booking system
3. Better website
4. Better presence on international booking platforms
5. More social media followers

**Pattern**: Infrastructure (website, booking, payments) precedes marketing tactics—they recognize they need systems in place before scaling reach.

### Enthusiasm for Group Training

When asked about interest in group digital marketing training:
- **5 respondents**: "Yes, definitely"
- **1 respondent**: "Yes, if it's affordable"  
- **1 respondent**: "Maybe, depends on the details"

**None said no.** This represents 100% openness to training, with 86% expressing strong interest.

## Key Insights for Program Design

### 1. **They Need Strategic Frameworks, Not Platform Tutorials**

Respondents already know *how* to post on Facebook. What they need is:
- How to identify and reach target customer segments
- How to measure what's working
- How to create content calendars and plan campaigns
- How to convert followers into customers

### 2. **Infrastructure Before Scale**

The tour operators' prioritization is instructive: they want payment systems and booking infrastructure *before* marketing training. Programs should offer:
- **Phase 1**: Set up core infrastructure (website, booking, payments)
- **Phase 2**: Develop content strategy and audience targeting
- **Phase 3**: Scale reach and optimize conversion

### 3. **Address the Device Gap**

Five of seven rely solely on smartphones. While impressive that they manage so much from mobile, this limits their ability to:
- Use professional design tools
- Manage complex booking systems
- Analyze data in spreadsheets
- Create longer-form content

Consider:
- **Computer literacy training** alongside digital marketing
- **Shared workspace/computer lab** access for participants
- **Mobile-first tool recommendations** (apps that work well on smartphones)

### 4. **Language-Inclusive Content Strategy**

With 29% citing language as a barrier, and all serving both local and international audiences, training must address:
- Creating multilingual content efficiently
- Tools for translation and localization
- Cultural considerations in visual content (less text-dependent)
- Voice/video content in local languages

### 5. **Peer Learning Potential**

Several respondents noted they seek help from "other business owners" and "ask friends/family for recommendations." The survey sample includes:
- **Advanced tier** (Abuko Pottery) who could mentor
- **Similar-sized businesses** facing identical challenges
- **Cross-sector learning** (arts learning from tours, vice versa)

**Recommendation**: Design group training with structured peer learning components—case study presentations, accountability partners, WhatsApp learning groups.

---

## Unexpected Findings

### 1. **High Digital Literacy Baseline**

All respondents reported being "very comfortable" or "somewhat comfortable" with digital tools. This is higher than expected and suggests:
- Survey may have attracted more digitally-engaged respondents
- The barriers are strategic/resource-based, not fundamental digital literacy

### 2. **No Review Strategy**

Despite active social media use, most have minimal review presence:
- Only 1-2 review platforms per business
- Several marked "We don't get reviews" or "word of mouth only"

This represents a significant gap given the importance of social proof for tourists. Review management should be a core training component.

### 3. **Content Creation Confusion**

Several respondents simultaneously:
- Post weekly on social media
- Said they "don't create promotional content"
- Yet selected options like "I take my own photos" and "I write descriptions"

This suggests they don't recognize their social media activity *as* content creation. Training should **reframe existing activities** as valuable marketing work and show how to optimize what they're already doing.

---

## Limitations & Context

### Sample Size
With only 7 responses (8% of participants), findings should be interpreted cautiously. However:
- The **tight clustering of scores** (17.0 ± 1.8 points) suggests consistency
- **Qualitative themes are remarkably uniform** across all seven
- The **breadth of sectors** (5 different) provides useful diversity

### Self-Selection Bias
Respondents who completed a 10-minute survey about digital capacity are likely:
- More digitally engaged than non-respondents
- More motivated to improve
- More comfortable with forms/technology

**Implication**: The broader participant pool may have *lower* average capacity, making these findings potentially optimistic. Non-respondents may need more foundational support.

### Response Timing
All responses came September-October 2025, a period when:
- Tourism season is building (potentially busier, less survey time)
- Creative industries may be planning for festival season
- Digital challenges are top-of-mind during high-activity periods

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (1-2 months)
1. **Launch pilot group training** with these 7 respondents:
   - They've expressed interest
   - Small cohort allows testing curriculum
   - Mixed sectors enable peer learning
   - Can document outcomes for broader rollout

2. **Create resource library** addressing top needs:
   - "Setting up online payments in The Gambia"
   - "Creating multilingual social media content"
   - "Smartphone photography for businesses"
   - "Free tools for tracking social media metrics"

3. **Follow-up interviews** with 2-3 respondents:
   - Deep-dive on challenges
   - Test training content ideas
   - Build relationship for pilot program

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
1. **Boost survey response rate**:
   - Offer incentive (free 1-hour consultation?)
   - Promote through sector associations
   - Shorten survey to 5 minutes for broader reach
   - Translate to Wolof/Mandinka

2. **Develop tiered training tracks**:
   - **Intermediate Track** (for these respondents): Strategy, optimization, analytics
   - **Beginner Track** (for lower-capacity non-respondents): Platform basics, content creation 101
   - **Advanced Track** (for Abuko Pottery level): E-commerce, paid advertising, automation

3. **Address infrastructure gaps**:
   - Partner with tech providers for group discounts on website hosting
   - Negotiate data packages with telecoms for participants
   - Create shared resource: photographer, content creator, graphic designer

---

## Conclusion

The initial survey responses paint a picture of **aspiring digital entrepreneurs held back not by lack of effort, but by lack of strategic guidance and resources**. These seven businesses are already doing the hard work of daily digital engagement—what they need now is the knowledge to make that work more effective and the infrastructure to scale it.

The near-universal request for training, combined with moderate scores indicating room for growth, suggests a **"ready-to-learn" moment** that programs should capitalize on. These aren't businesses starting from zero; they're practitioners ready to level up.

Most encouragingly, the challenges they face—cost uncertainty, platform overload, smartphone limitations—are all **addressable through targeted interventions**. Unlike fundamental digital literacy barriers, these are problems that training, peer learning, and strategic guidance can directly solve.

The question isn't whether these businesses can improve their digital capacity. Based on their current activity levels and expressed motivation, the answer is clearly yes. The question is: **Will we provide the support structure to help them do so?**

## Cross-Reference Analysis: Internal vs. External Assessment

A powerful dimension of our dual assessment approach becomes evident when we compare the **external observation scores** (0-70 scale) with the **self-reported survey scores** (0-30 scale). This cross-reference reveals critical insights about self-awareness, hidden capabilities, and strategic opportunities for capacity building.

### The Alignment Pattern

Converting both assessments to percentage scales for comparison, we observe an intriguing pattern:

**Overall Averages**:
- External Assessment Average: **48.6%** (34.0/70 points)
- Survey Assessment Average: **58.3%** (17.5/30 points)
- Gap: **+9.7 percentage points** (survey higher)

This modest upward skew in self-assessment—where participants rate themselves slightly higher than external evaluators—is neither problematic nor unusual. It suggests **realistic self-perception** rather than the dramatic overconfidence or imposter syndrome that would indicate misalignment. In fact, 1 participant shows perfect alignment (Flex Fuzion at 57% on both scales), and 4 out of 7 participants fall within a ±15 percentage point range, indicating strong correlation.

### Individual Capacity-Building Opportunities

When we examine individual participants, the relationship between external and internal scores reveals distinct opportunity profiles:

**1. The Balanced High-Performers** (External ≈ Survey, both >50%)
- **Bushwhacker Tours**: 76% external, 60% survey
- **Flex Fuzion Entertainment**: 57% external, 57% survey

These organizations demonstrate both observable digital presence AND internal confidence/capability. They are **ideal candidates for advanced training** and could serve as **peer mentors** to others. Their capacity-building needs focus on sophistication rather than basics: analytics integration, conversion optimization, strategic content planning.

**2. The Ready Foundations** (Survey > External, mid-range)
- **Abuko Pottery Center**: 50% external, 68% survey  
- **Ebunjan Theatre**: 48% external, 59% survey
- **Yaws Creations**: 50% external, 58% survey

This group shows **higher internal capability than their current digital footprint reveals**. They possess knowledge, skills, and tools but aren't fully leveraging them in their public-facing presence. The gap suggests they would benefit from **strategic guidance** and **content strategy support** more than basic digital literacy training. They know how to use the tools; they need help knowing *what* to create and *when* to post for maximum impact.

**3. The Implementation Support Needed** (External > Survey, significant gap)
- **Eco Tours**: 59% external, 50% survey

Eco Tours presents an interesting inversion: their external digital presence is stronger than their self-reported confidence. This pattern often indicates a business that has received external help (perhaps from a marketing consultant or tech-savvy staff member) but where **knowledge transfer hasn't fully occurred**. Their capacity-building priority should be **operational training**—teaching the existing team to manage and maintain what's already been built, rather than building new infrastructure.

**4. The Starting Block** (Low external, moderate survey)
- **Galloya Street Arts**: 0% external, 57% survey

This represents the most interesting capacity-building opportunity: a business with dormant digital skills but no current public presence. Their moderate survey score indicates they have basic familiarity and access, but for some reason haven't translated this into action. Investigation into **barriers beyond capability**—perhaps time, confidence, or clarity about what to create—will be essential. This is where **intensive incubation-style support** could yield dramatic results quickly.

### Strategic Implications for Capacity Building Programs

The cross-reference analysis reveals that a **one-size-fits-all training approach would be inefficient**. Instead, the dual assessment framework enables us to design targeted interventions:

**Tier 1 – Strategic Accelerator** (Bushwhacker Tours, Flex Fuzion)  
*Focus*: Advanced digital strategy, analytics, conversion optimization, ROI measurement  
*Format*: Masterclass-style sessions with peer exchange opportunities  
*Impact Timeline*: Immediate; these businesses can implement sophisticated strategies quickly

**Tier 2 – Content & Strategy Intensive** (Abuko Pottery, Ebunjan Theatre, Yaws Creations)  
*Focus*: Content planning, visual storytelling, audience engagement tactics, brand positioning  
*Format*: Workshop series with practical assignments and group feedback  
*Impact Timeline*: 3-6 months; focus on consistency and strategic thinking

**Tier 3 – Operations & Sustainability** (Eco Tours)  
*Focus*: Knowledge transfer, operational workflows, team training, maintenance protocols  
*Format*: One-on-one consultation paired with documentation creation  
*Impact Timeline*: 2-4 months; emphasis on empowering existing staff

**Tier 4 – Launch Incubator** (Galloya Street Arts)  
*Focus*: Barrier identification, confidence building, initial content creation, launch strategy  
*Format*: Intensive sprint with ongoing mentorship  
*Impact Timeline*: 1-3 months for launch; 6-12 months for sustained activity

### The Capacity-Building Investment Case

The alignment between external and survey assessments validates that our participants generally **understand their digital capacity accurately**. This is crucial because it means:

1. **They can articulate their own learning needs** effectively, making them better training participants
2. **They're unlikely to resist feedback** since their self-perception isn't dramatically inflated
3. **They can assess their own progress** post-intervention, enabling more sustainable long-term growth

Furthermore, the concentration of scores in the **Intermediate range (48-68%)** suggests this cohort is in the **optimal zone for rapid advancement**. They're past the painful beginner stage but haven't hit diminishing returns on training investment. Small interventions here can yield disproportionate results—this is the sweet spot for capacity-building ROI.

The external assessments show that even the highest performers have clear gaps (particularly in areas like digital sales integration and platform connectivity), while the survey assessments confirm they're aware of limitations and hungry to improve. This combination of **visible room for growth** + **internal motivation** + **moderate existing capability** represents a **near-ideal scenario for intervention success**.
