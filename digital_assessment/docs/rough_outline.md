Automation Workflow Structure
Phase 1: Data Collection Automation

Website Scanning: Automated detection and basic analysis
Social Media Discovery: Platform presence detection and basic metrics
Search Visibility Assessment: Google ranking and GMB status
Review Platform Analysis: Review count and sentiment analysis

Phase 2: Technical Performance Assessment

PageSpeed Analysis: Loading speed and mobile responsiveness
SEO Audit: Basic on-page SEO factors
Accessibility Check: WCAG compliance assessment

Phase 3: Manual Review Integration

Content Quality Review: Human assessment of visual content
Engagement Quality Assessment: Manual review of customer interactions
Strategic Assessment: Human evaluation of digital marketing integration

Recommended Implementation Approach
Option 1: Hybrid Automation (Recommended)

Automated data collection for technical metrics (60% of scoring)
Manual assessment for quality and strategy components (40% of scoring)
Estimated time savings: 70% reduction in assessment time per stakeholder

Option 2: Claude.ai Analysis Integration

Upload stakeholder list with contact information and websites
Use Claude for content analysis of websites and social media
Automated scoring based on predefined criteria
Manual verification of final scores

Sample Python Script Structure
pythonclass DigitalAssessmentAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scoring_framework = {
            'website_performance': 25,
            'social_media': 20,
            'search_visibility': 15,
            'ecommerce': 15,
            'reviews': 10,
            'content_marketing': 15
        }
    
    def assess_stakeholder(self, organization_data):
        scores = {}
        
        # Automated assessments
        scores['technical'] = self.assess_website_technical(organization_data['website'])
        scores['search'] = self.assess_search_visibility(organization_data['name'])
        scores['platforms'] = self.detect_social_platforms(organization_data)
        
        # Semi-automated assessments
        scores['content_basic'] = self.basic_content_analysis(organization_data)
        
        # Manual assessment flags
        scores['requires_manual_review'] = self.flag_manual_components(organization_data)
        
        return self.calculate_total_score(scores)
    
    def generate_stakeholder_report(self, stakeholder_list):
        results = []
        for stakeholder in stakeholder_list:
            assessment = self.assess_stakeholder(stakeholder)
            results.append(assessment)
        
        return self.create_summary_dashboard(results)
Implementation Timeline
Week 1: Setup and Testing

API access configuration (Google, social media platforms)
Basic script development and testing with 10 pilot stakeholders
Manual scoring validation for accuracy verification

Week 2: Full Deployment

Automated assessment of full stakeholder list (150+ organizations)
Manual review of flagged components
Final scoring compilation and dashboard generation

Resource Requirements
Technical Setup:

Google Cloud Platform account for API access ($50-100 for assessment period)
Social media developer accounts (Facebook, Instagram APIs)
Python environment with required libraries

Time Investment:

Initial setup: 8-10 hours
Per-stakeholder automated processing: ~5 minutes
Manual review per stakeholder: ~15 minutes
Total time for 150 stakeholders: ~50 hours vs. 300 hours fully manual

Data Output Structure
Stakeholder Assessment Database:

Individual scores by category
Technical performance metrics
Platform presence matrix
Priority improvement recommendations
Manual review flags and notes

Dashboard Generation:

Sector-by-sector comparison charts
Digital maturity distribution
Geographic analysis
Priority intervention identification

This automation framework would provide consistent, scalable assessment while maintaining quality standards necessary for your TOR deliverable requirements.
