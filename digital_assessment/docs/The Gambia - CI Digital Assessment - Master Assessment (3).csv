Ebunjan Theatre Company,Performing and visual arts,Greater Banjul Area,7,0,10,8,2,3,,,,,,30,,30,Emerging,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Ebunjan Theatre maintains a basic social media presence. They have an official Facebook page (@EbunJan) providing updates on plays and events
my-gambia.com
, and an active Instagram account for the theatre. Engagement is modest (on the order of a few hundred followers), but the theatre does use these channels regularly to announce performances and cultural programs. Their social presence is focused and community-oriented, though not multi-platform beyond FB/IG.","No dedicated website. Ebunjan does not have its own official website; however, it benefits from coverage on other sites. (For example, a feature on My Gambia magazine tells the story of the theatre and provides contact details.) Generally, information about Ebunjan is available via social media and third-party articles, but not on a standalone theatre website.","High-quality visuals of productions and venue. Ebunjan Theatre is known for professional stage productions, and images of its plays and the unique dome-shaped auditorium are often of good quality. Promotional photos in media and on their pages show clear, well-lit shots of actors on stage and the facility. The theatre’s “Gift of Janet” feature in My Gambia included vibrant photographs of the venue and performances. While not a constant flow of content, when they do share visuals (including event flyers or recap photos), the quality is semi-professional and does justice to the performances.","Ebunjan Theatre has strong online discoverability for a local cultural venue. It appears on Google Maps/Google Search with location, and importantly has positive audience reviews on travel platforms. On Google, the theatre holds about a 4.8/5 rating (from several reviews) for its venue and shows. It’s also listed on TripAdvisor as an attraction in Banjul. Searching the name brings up their Facebook page, TripAdvisor listing, and articles, all on the first page. This indicates that both tourists and locals find information about the theatre easily, and its reputation is good (“amazing acting and beautiful venue,” notes one visitor).","Basic inquiry/booking only. To attend a play or rent the venue, one must typically call or visit the theatre. There is no online ticket purchase system. However, Ebunjan does provide a phone number and responds to inquiries via Facebook. In essence, reservations and event bookings are handled offline (pay at the door or by arrangement). The score reflects that interested patrons can reach out digitally (via social media or email) but cannot complete transactions online.","Ebunjan Theatre is integrated into relevant cultural and tourism platforms. It is listed on TripAdvisor with traveler reviews and basic info, indicating a presence in the international travel community. It’s also mentioned on local event calendars and has partnerships (for instance, events are sometimes in collaboration with bodies like the U.S. Embassy or local cultural organizations). While their team could do more in terms of coordinating across all possible platforms, being on Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and Facebook constitutes a good level of integration for a theatre in The Gambia.",,https://www.facebook.com/EbunJan/,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293795-d26847318-Reviews-Ebunjan_Theater-Banjul_Banjul_Division.html,

senegambiacraftmarket.com. The Facebook page has only ~50 likes and the Instagram account shows no posts to date. There is no evidence of regular engagement or multi-platform strategy.","An official website exists and provides background, services (craft types), and contact details. The site is professionally designed and includes an About section and a blog. However, several sections are “coming soon” or not regularly updated, and no frequent updates have been made in the last year. Basic contact forms are available for inquiries.","The digital platforms feature a variety of photos of crafts and artisans. The official website uses high-resolution images of products and “meet the makers” profiles, suggesting a semi-professional photoshoot was done. Visuals are clear and well-composed (e.g. showcasing woodcarvers, beadwork, textiles) and align with the market’s branding. There is room to improve consistency and add video content, but overall visual asset quality is solid for a local market.","The market is easily found via search – the official site and TripAdvisor listing appear on the first page of Google results. A Google Maps listing exists (approx. 4.3★ rating) with dozens of reviews. Travelers have reviewed it extensively on TripAdvisor (~214 reviews), and on Google (aggregated ~4★ from hundreds of user ratings). This indicates a positive reputation and decent search presence. However, there’s no evidence of active management of online reviews (e.g. owner responses), so full optimization is not achieved.","There is no e-commerce or online booking system for the craft market. Sales are in-person only – the website’s “Shop” section currently has no products listed. The site does provide a contact form for inquiries (and mentions you can “plan your visits”), which qualifies as a basic digital inquiry channel. There is no integration of online payments or booking for tours, aside from third-party tour sites offering visits.","The market is listed on major travel platforms like TripAdvisor and Google Maps, and mentioned on Gambia tourism sites. The TripAdvisor profile is active with many traveler reviews and photos, and the official website even links to it, showing awareness of that platform. While these listings are populated (largely by users) and provide info (hours, location)
, there isn’t evidence of a coordinated, “optimized” management across all platforms. Still, being on Google, TripAdvisor, Facebook, Instagram, and local directories constitutes a good basic integration.",https://www.senegambiacraftmarket.com/,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297575-d5962209-Reviews-Senegambia_Craft_Market-Kololi_Serekunda_Banjul_Division.html,

They are active on Instagram (@mygambiatravel) and even TikTok (15k+ followers) as well, indicating professional management and daily engagement across channels.","The project runs a professional, content-rich website (my-gambia.com) that is regularly updated. The site features an online magazine with new articles in multiple categories (Travel, People, News, etc.) through Aug 2025, as well as a directory and trips booking section. The website is well-designed, comprehensive, and kept current (updated within the last 3 months).","My Gambia’s visuals are highly professional. They have shared over 800 videos on YouTube (travel vlogs, interviews, etc.) and high-quality photographs in their articles. The branding is consistent and images (e.g. in their online magazine and social posts) are clear, well-composed, and vibrant, reflecting studio-level photography and videography standards.","The platform shows excellent discoverability. Searching “My Gambia magazine” or related terms yields their official site and social profiles on the first page. They dominate results in their niche. Their brand’s strong web presence and large audience serve as a positive online reputation. While user-generated reviews aren’t applicable to a magazine, their content and name are highly visible in search results.","My Gambia offers a “Trips & Activities” section where users can browse and inquire about tours and services online.

Their Instagram (@flexfuziondancegambia) has ~1.1k followers and showcases the academy’s dance activities. The academy frequently shares updates (e.g. representing Gambia at international competitions) and engages with its audience, but its reach remains moderate. (They have a YouTube channel and news features, but not a large multi-platform following yet.)","No dedicated website was found for Flex Fuzion. The group relies on social media pages for information and promotion. There is no standalone website or web page for the academy’s services – contact is via Facebook/Instagram and community networks. (They are listed on a business directory and featured in news articles, but no official site.)","Good amateur visuals. Flex Fuzion shares photos and videos of performances and classes on social media. Many images are clear but likely taken with smartphones or basic cameras. Some professional photos appear in media coverage (e.g. when they performed abroad
), but the overall visual content, while vibrant, is not consistently professionally produced. Quality is acceptable and conveys their performances energetically.","The academy has decent search visibility. A Google search of their name brings up their Facebook page and news articles about them (e.g. their dancers’ international achievements). They are mentioned in local press and even government cultural reports. However, they don’t have an official Google Business listing or many user reviews. They can be found online, but their search presence is tied mostly to news/media pieces and social pages rather than an optimized official profile.","Basic inquiry only. There is no online booking or payment system. Interested persons must contact them via phone, Facebook, or WhatsApp to enroll in classes or book performances. Flex Fuzion provides contact info for inquiries and takes bookings/offers via messaging, but no e-commerce or online ticketing exists.","Flex Fuzion is listed on a few relevant platforms. They appear on an international talent directory and local event listings, showing effort to integrate beyond just social media. They collaborate with bodies like the Dance Association of The Gambia and have partnered with cultural institutions (e.g. Alliance Française workshops
facebook.com

Gambia Union of Theatre (GAMUT),Performing and visual arts,Greater Banjul Area,7,0,3,2,0,0,,,,,,12,,12,Absent,,,,9/11/2025,,,"GAMUT has an emerging social media footprint, primarily on Facebook and Twitter. As an umbrella organization uniting drama, dance, comedy, and film practitioners, it shares news and opportunities for theatre artists. Their Facebook page (Gambia Union of Theatre – GAMUT) posts updates about training workshops, World Theatre Day events, etc., though the following is not large. They also have a Twitter/X account (@GambiaGamut) used for advocacy and announcements. The content is not daily, but the presence is official and engages members periodically.",No official website. GAMUT does not operate a dedicated website; information about it is available through social media or press releases. No standalone GAMUT web portal exists for resources or membership info (they rely on NCAC announcements and their Facebook page).,"Basic event photos. As an association, GAMUT’s visual content is generally limited to photos of meetings, group workshops, and event flyers. Images shared (for example, on Facebook or news articles) are usually candid shots of participants or simple graphics. They serve their purpose but are often low-resolution or taken on smartphones. There is little in terms of polished, branded visuals – the focus is on informational content.","Limited discoverability. A search for GAMUT yields some news (e.g. Voice Gambia articles on World Theatre Day) and possibly their Facebook page. However, without a website or significant media profile, they are not highly visible to a general audience. One would have to specifically look for “GAMUT Gambia” to find relevant info. They are referenced in cultural policy documents, but those are niche. In short, they exist online but have a low profile to anyone outside the performing arts circles.",Not applicable. GAMUT is an association and does not offer products or ticketed services.,"Minimal platform integration. GAMUT isn’t listed on public cultural directories or event platforms in a way the general public would see. Its integration is mostly institutional (under NCAC support). There is no presence on tourism or ticketing platforms. (Their collaborations, like co-hosting World Theatre Day with NCAC, are communicated via press rather than platform profiles.)",,https://www.facebook.com/gambiaunionoftheatre/?locale=fr_FR&_rdr,,,
Visual Arts Association of The Gambia (VAAG),Performing and visual arts,Greater Banjul Area,7,6,10,5,0,1,,,,,,29,,29,Emerging,,,,9/11/2025,,,"VAAG manages an official Facebook page and potentially other social accounts (their website links to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram). The engagement on Facebook is moderate; they post about exhibitions, artist spotlights, and association news (like their annual congress). They are not yet a social media powerhouse but do maintain a regular presence for their members. (For instance, VAAG went to congress in Nov 2024 and this was publicized online.)","Functional association website. VAAG has an official website (vaag.gm) which contains news updates, artist profiles, and even an image gallery. The site is fairly comprehensive: it publishes articles on Gambian artists and VAAG news (e.g. coverage of their November 2024 Congress). However, the update frequency has slowed in 2025. The site is professionally made and served as a central info hub up to late 2024, but content updates in the past 6+ months have been sparse. It is a solid resource (with events, mission, etc.), just not constantly updated.","Quality art visuals and galleries. Given VAAG’s focus, their content often features images of artwork and artists. The website’s gallery shows curated art pieces (paintings, etc.), and posts include photos of exhibition openings and artist works. Many of these images are high-resolution and show the art in good lighting, indicating semi-professional handling. For example, the VAAG site includes an “Our Collections” gallery with photographs of members’ artworks. While some social posts (e.g. event pics) are more casual, the overall visual presentation of art is quite good.","VAAG has a decent online footprint for those searching Gambian art. Their official website appears in search results (and clearly states their mission to promote fine arts and preserve culture
). They are also mentioned in news (such as mounting a 60th Independence art exhibition). However, outside of arts-specific searches, they are not widely reviewed or referenced by general travel sources. They do appear in official documents and have a unique name, so interested parties can find them. With time, better SEO on their site could raise this further.",No e-commerce. VAAG’s site does not facilitate sales of artwork or tickets; it’s an association portal. Any sale of art by members is handled individually or via exhibitions (offline).,"Basic listing presence. VAAG is primarily integrated through its own channels and collaborations with NCAC. It is one of the officially recognized artist associations, but it’s not featured on tourism or large art marketplaces. It does have a presence on a local business directory (Xippia) and posts on government/partner pages when relevant.

Association of Fashion Designers of The Gambia (AFDG),Fashion & Design,Greater Banjul Area,3,0,3,2,0,1,,,,,,9,,9,Absent,,,,9/11/2025,,,"AFDG’s official social media presence is very limited. There is a Facebook page titled “Association of Fashion Designers of The Gambia,” but it has only a few followers and minimal activity. This indicates only a basic attempt at a social presence. There is no significant content strategy or engagement; the page mainly exists in name with occasional posts about industry events (like Miss Gambia pageant collaborations). No active Instagram or Twitter specific to the association is evident.","No functioning website. The association ostensibly had a website (fashiondesigners.gm) as per their Facebook info, but that site is not operational (and appears to have been defunct or compromised). In practice, AFDG disseminates information through press conferences and partner organizations rather than an official site.","Sparse and informal visuals. As an association, AFDG itself produces little original visual content. Photos that do appear on their Facebook or in media are often snapshots from events (e.g. group photos at a press briefing or designers showcasing outfits at a charity donation). These are typically of low to average quality. There is no consistent visual branding or high-quality imagery being put out by the association directly.","AFDG has low discoverability online. A general search might pull up a Facebook page or an allAfrica news piece about one of their activities. They are also mentioned in the national Creative Industries Roadmap. However, without an active site or social feed, they are not easily found by the public. One basically finds them via news of events they co-organize (like Miss Gambia 2022) or through references in documents, rather than an active web presence.",Not applicable. The association doesn’t engage in commerce; it doesn’t sell products or services directly.,"Minimal integration. AFDG is primarily an offline entity. It isn’t listed on consumer platforms (since it’s an industry body). The only integration of note is through collaborations – for example, working with the tourism ministry on pageants or being listed alongside peer associations in reports. Aside from a basic Facebook page listing, there’s little platform presence.",,https://www.facebook.com/p/Association-of-Fashion-Designers-of-The-Gambia-100068624205432/,,,
Yaws Creation,Fashion & Design,Greater Banjul Area,12,0,15,8,2,3,,,,,,40,,40,Intermediate,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Yaws Creations (founded by designer Ya Awa Conateh) has a strong social media presence and brand following. The business’s Facebook page has over 6,200 likes and frequently showcases new designs, behind-the-scenes of fashion shows, and media features. Yaws is also active on Instagram, often under Awa’s personal handle, highlighting her contemporary African fashion work. Additionally, Yaws Creations has been featured on TikTok and international forums. The multi-platform engagement (Facebook, Instagram, and mentions on TikTok/YouTube) and a sizeable following indicate a well-managed online presence, though not quite a daily multi-platform blitz to warrant full marks.","No dedicated e-commerce site. Despite its fame, Yaws Creation does not maintain an official website for retail. Its online hub is primarily social media. (There were references to an old blog/tumblr, but no active website now.) Customers usually learn about products via Facebook/Instagram and then contact Yaws directly for orders or visit the physical boutique in Bakau","Top-notch visual content. Being a fashion brand, Yaws Creations invests in high-quality imagery. They have professional photoshoots for collections (evident in their “Get Poisoned” campaign era which involved professional models, MUAs, and photographers). On social media, Yaws consistently shares polished images of designs, runway shots from fashion weeks, and stylish product photos. The brand’s visual storytelling is excellent, translating traditional prints into modern chic visuals, which has garnered international attention.","Yaws Creation is one of the most recognizable Gambian fashion brands online. A search readily shows its Facebook page, press interviews, and features by organizations like ITC’s Ethical Fashion Initiative. There are news articles profiling Awa Conateh’s journey, e.g. on Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and local media. The brand’s boutique is listed on Google Maps (Bakau, Sait Matty Junction, with contact info in media). While user-generated “reviews” aren’t common (fashion clients don’t usually leave public reviews), the brand’s presence and reputation are strongly established across multiple channels.","Inquiries via DM, no online store. Yaws Creations does not have an online storefront; however, they take orders via direct messages on social platforms and WhatsApp. The process is that customers see items posted and then reach out to arrange purchase/shipping. Payment is then handled through offline means or bank transfer. So, there is a digital inquiry/order channel, but no integrated online payment or cart system.","Yaws Creations has moderate platform integration. The brand has been featured on international fashion platforms: for example, it was profiled on ITC’s portal and in My Gambia’s fashion column. Locally, it’s often part of Fashion Weekend Gambia and other events, which puts it on those event platforms. It’s also listed on travel blogs as a place to find authentic fashion in Gambia. This cross-mentioning on event and travel platforms (though not e-commerce marketplaces) boosts its profile.",,https://www.facebook.com/Yawscreations/,https://www.instagram.com/yawscreations/?hl=en,,
Poison Fashion Designs,Fashion & Design,Greater Banjul Area,3,0,10,5,0,3,,,,,,21,,21,Emerging,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Minimal social presence. Poison Fashion Designs (led by designer Y.S.M, a.k.a. “WhyEssEmm”) does not maintain a strong social media profile today. There is evidence of a Tumblr blog used years ago to showcase designs and slogans (“Always addictive. Get Poisoned.”), but currently the brand’s visibility on Facebook or Instagram is low to nonexistent. The designer herself appears more active in other fields now, and the brand’s online activity has dwindled, indicating just a very basic presence historically.",No official website. Poison Fashion has no dedicated website or online shop. Its online information exists mainly on directory listings (e.g. Access Gambia) and that outdated Tumblr blog. No functional site for the brand is available.,"High-quality fashion visuals (past collections). During its peak, Poison Fashion Designs produced some professional visual content. For instance, one collection’s shoot involved professional photography, makeup artists, and models, resulting in quality images of garments (bow ties, gowns, etc.). The Access Gambia page describes the variety of stylish pieces in the collection. However, since fresh content is not being generated recently, the score reflects the archived quality of visuals rather than ongoing output.","Poison Fashion Designs is findable online primarily via fashion directories. It’s listed on AccessGambia with full contact info and description, which appears quickly in search results and effectively serves as its web presence. Additionally, some older press and the Tumblr blog appear in search results for the brand name. While it’s not on social media now, one can still discover the business through these static sources, which provide essential information (location at Kololi Village, phone numbers, etc.). The brand’s search visibility is decent within a Gambian context, thanks to those directories.",No digital commerce. Poison Fashion’s sales are strictly in-person at the boutique (Kololi) or by direct communication. No online ordering system exists.,"he brand is integrated into local fashion directories and networks. The AccessGambia listing (under Fashion Designers and Tailoring) ensures it’s on a major local platform. It has also been mentioned by the Fashion Designers Association in passing. While not present on global e-commerce or social selling platforms, being on AccessGambia (a key resource for tourists and investors) is a significant integration, providing it a basic online platform for visibility.",,,,,
Sawallo Couture,Fashion & Design,,18,12,15,8,8,3,,,,,,64,,64,Advanced,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Excellent, multi-platform presence. Sawallo (often spelled “Sawallow”) Couture is very active online. They operate an Instagram profile (@sawallow_couture_ltd) showcasing their products with an authentic African flair, a Facebook page for local outreach, and even engage users on TikTok (promoting store openings and new collections). Their Facebook page has a large following (several thousands of followers). They post frequently (new designs, client features, promotions) and interact with customers daily. This broad and consistent social engagement across at least three platforms indicates a comprehensive strategy.","Fully developed e-commerce website. Sawallo Couture runs a professional online store (sawallowcouture.com) with shopping cart, product categories for men and women, and even a customer login system. The site is modern, easy to navigate, and kept current (store information reflects their new Kotu location and 2025 copyright). They provide an online catalog of outfits (e.g. dresses, “Grand Mboubas,” suits, accessories) and even a newsletter subscription. The presence of features like an online cart and listed payment methods shows the site is fully functional for online sales.","High-quality, professional visuals. Sawallo’s online images — whether on their website or social media — are crisp and professionally done. Product photos on the site are well-lit against clean backgrounds (typical of e-commerce fashion photography). On Instagram and Facebook, they share high-resolution photos of models wearing their garments, as well as videos from fashion shows. The consistency and polish of their visual content conveys an established brand identity, matching what one would expect from a “luxury kaftan” and couture outlet.","Sawallo Couture is becoming highly discoverable online. A Google search immediately finds their official website, which clearly identifies them as a top fashion store in Serrekunda. Their social media pages also appear in results. Additionally, they are listed on AccessGambia (under tailoring/fashion) with address and contacts. The business has a Google Maps pin (Opposite Palma Rima, Kotu) and is gradually accruing a reputation beyond Gambia’s borders. While they may not yet have many online customer reviews, their strong official web presence ensures they are visible and accessible.","Full digital commerce integration. Sawallo Couture offers complete online shopping. Customers can browse items by category (men, women, accessories), add items to a cart, and proceed to checkout on their website. The site accepts online payments (major cards/mobile money), as indicated by the payment icons and “We accept:” section. They also provide WhatsApp for customer service and take orders there, giving multiple avenues for digital sales. This multi-channel sales approach (website store + social commerce) represents the highest level of digital transaction capability.","Sawallo is present on relevant platforms. Locally, they appear in fashion business listings and were noted in “top tailor” TikTok mentions. They collaborate with Fashion Weekend Gambia (thus featured on FWG’s platforms as a designer). Internationally, while not yet on marketplaces like Etsy, they do ship internationally and market to the diaspora through social media. They’ve effectively integrated their offerings with both a brick-and-mortar experience and an online platform, but further integration with global fashion marketplaces or travel guides (for shopping tourists) could improve to reach a full score.",,https://www.facebook.com/sawallowcouturegambia/,https://www.instagram.com/sawallow_couture_ltd/?hl=en,,
Sierra Designs Tailoring,Fashion & Design,,3,0,6,5,0,1,,,,,,15,,15,Absent,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Modest social presence. Sierra Designs (run by veteran designer “Aunty” Chan Khan Jallow) has a Facebook page under “Sierra’s Design” aimed at showcasing their work. The page content is straightforward, highlighting that they’ve been in fashion for over two decades. However, the following is small and engagement is low. They are not active on Instagram or other platforms, relying mostly on Facebook and word-of-mouth.",No website. Sierra Designs does not have an official website. Their online information is provided via the Access Gambia business directory and their Facebook page. No dedicated site or online portfolio exists for the shop.,"Decent, but informal visuals. Being a tailoring shop, most visuals are of finished outfits on mannequins or clients, shared via Facebook or taken in-store. The quality varies: some images of their couture gowns or traditional wear are quite nice and give a sense of the garment detail, but they are typically smartphone photos in shop lighting. They do convey the elegance of the African outfits albeit without professional staging. Overall, the imagery is acceptable but not highly polished.","Sierra Designs is readily discoverable through directories. It is listed on AccessGambia with full contact details (physical address on Kairaba Avenue, phone, email). That listing appears quickly on Google. Additionally, the business is mentioned in creative industry documents and is known as the first fashion training mentor (mentor to Ida’s Ideas). So, while they don’t have their own site, anyone searching for tailors in Gambia or Sierra’s Design will find reliable info via the directory listing and Facebook.",No online commerce. Sierra Designs operates traditionally. Clients must visit the shop for measurements/orders or call to make inquiries. There is no online order or payment system.,"The business is minimally integrated in digital platforms. Its strongest integration is being on Access Gambia’s “Tailoring Shops” and “Fashion Designers” listings. This is a static but important platform for visibility. Beyond that, Sierra Designs isn’t on e-commerce or international fashion platforms. It largely relies on its longstanding reputation and network in the local fashion community rather than digital platform outreach.",,,,,
Edwin Apparels (Edwin Tailoring),Fashion & Design,,0,0,0,2,0,1,,,,,,3,,3,Absent,,,,9/11/2025,,,"No social media presence. Edwin Apparels (also known as Edward/Edwin Standard Tailoring) is an old-established men’s tailor shop and does not maintain Facebook, Instagram, or other social accounts. It caters to a clientele that typically reaches them in person. There’s no evidence of any social media marketing.","No website. Like many traditional tailors, Edwin has no official site or online portal. Its presence online is limited to a listing on AccessGambia (under tailoring services).","No digital visual content. The shop does not share any images online. There are no galleries or posts of suits or outfits; any visual impression is only from visiting the shop. (The AccessGambia entry does not include photos, just text.)","Barely discoverable online. Searching “Edwin Standard Tailoring Gambia” leads to an Access Gambia page that, confusingly, labels it as “Edward Standard Tailoring”. The information is there (address on Kairaba Ave and phone number), but without that specific search, the business is virtually invisible online. It has no Google Maps listing of its own (unless one knows the address). It exists in name in a few directories but isn’t optimized for search.",None. All orders are taken in person at the shop. There is no online ordering system.,"Basic directory listing. The only platform integration is the AccessGambia listing (as an “African apparel designer for men” on Kairaba Avenue). This provides it a minimal web footprint. It’s not represented on any social, travel, or fashion platform beyond that.",,,,,
Ida’s Ideas Fashion Design Training Institute,Fashion & Design,,12,0,10,8,0,3,,,,,,33,,33,Emerging,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Strong multi-platform presence. Ida’s Ideas is very active on social media as a premier fashion school. Their Facebook page (Ida’s Ideas Fashion & Design School) is regularly updated with student projects, enrollment info, and events; it highlights that they are the first fashion design school in the country. The page has a good following. They also run an Instagram account (@idas_ideas_fashion_institute) featuring highlights of student progress and institute achievements. Additionally, they engage on TikTok (with content like masterclass clips). This wide engagement across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok with consistent posting and interaction with aspirants earns a high score.","No official website. The institute does not appear to have its own website; it relies on social media for its online presence. (It is, however, listed on some business directories like Xippia and educational portals, but no dedicated site exists.)","High-quality and engaging visual content. As a fashion training institute, they frequently showcase the work of their students – from sketches to final runway outfits. Photos and videos from their student fashion shows and classes are of good quality, often professionally taken during their annual graduations or events. For example, posts show well-photographed scenes of students on the sewing machines, models wearing student-designed pieces, etc. The institute’s content is vibrant and inspiring, reflecting a semi-professional standard aligned with educational promotion.","Ida’s Ideas is highly visible online in the Gambian context. Searching their name immediately yields their Facebook page (with clear description of being Gambia’s first fashion design school in Bakau
) and Instagram content. They are also referenced in media – e.g. being a “trailblazer” in Gambian fashion education. The institute is listed on at least one business directory (Xippia) with background info. Given their unique offering, they appear in top results and are easily identified, including location (opposite Independence Stadium, Bakau). They have effectively built an online profile as the go-to fashion school.",No online enrollment or payment. Enrollment at Ida’s Ideas is done via application forms and in-person or email communication. There is no online payment portal for tuition; prospective students are asked to visit or contact the school directly (often advertised through Facebook posts). No part of their service (education) is sold online.,"The institute enjoys good integration within relevant platforms. They are featured on educational and creative industry directories (for instance, a profile on an entrepreneurship site describes their founding by Ida Saine-Conteh and Chan, her mentor). They advertise on job portals like GamJobs for recruiting students. They also partner with events (like fashion shows, youth empowerment programs), giving them presence on those event pages. While they could perhaps have a presence on official education portals, the current integration into social, business, and creative networks is solid.",,https://www.facebook.com/idasideasfashionschool/,https://www.instagram.com/idas_ideas_fashion_institute/,,
Gambia Models’ Union,Fashion & Design,,3,0,6,2,0,1,,,,,,12,,12,Absent,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Limited official presence. The Gambia Models’ Association (or Union) itself doesn’t have a very active dedicated page. There is a “Gambia Models Union” Facebook group and a “Gambia Models” promotional page (~4.8k likes) that promotes modeling opportunities, but it’s not clear if this is the formal association or a private agency. The formal association if any operates more behind the scenes. Thus, online, the modeling community is represented by a few pages/groups with modest activity (casting calls, model highlights) rather than one strong official account.","No website. There is no website for a models’ association. Any information is shared via social media or through event organizers (pageant organizers, fashion shows).","Mixed quality, community-sourced visuals. Modeling-related pages share a lot of photos of models – some are professional images from photoshoots or runway events (which are high quality), and others are candid or amateur snapshots from training sessions or castings. For example, model agencies in Gambia post both polished portfolio shots and casual “scouting” images. As an association, they likely use whatever content models and agencies provide. Overall, the visual content available is hit-or-miss, averaging to decent (many models’ individual Instagrams showcase high quality work, but the association’s own sharing might not be consistent or branded).","Hard to find formal info. A search for a Gambia Models Association yields scant direct info – mostly one finds related groups or agencies. The association doesn’t have a well-indexed identity online. It might be mentioned in the national creative roadmap but to an average user, information about “models association” comes through Facebook pages or media reports about modeling events. Unless one knows the specific pages to look for, the online presence is diffuse. This low findability reflects the informal nature of the network.","Not applicable. The association doesn’t sell anything; bookings of models are handled by agencies or directly with models, typically offline or via social contacts.","Very basic integration. The modeling association or community is tangentially integrated into event platforms (for instance, they collaborate with fashion show organizers, and those events get coverage on media and Paradise TV social pages). There isn’t a standalone platform listing for the association. However, the existence of active modeling agencies (e.g. Elite Modeling Agency Gambia) and a collective page suggests the community is using social platforms even if the association itself isn’t distinct. We give a point for at least having a presence in the social media ecosystem (Facebook groups where models gather).",,https://www.facebook.com/p/Gambia-Models-Union-100057354501998/,,,
Fashion Weekend Gambia ,Fashion & Design,,18,9,15,12,2,1,,,,,,57,,57,Intermediate,,,,9/11/2025,,,"Excellent social media engagement. Fashion Weekend Gambia (FWG) is Gambia’s premier annual fashion event and is very active on social platforms. Their Facebook page has over 8,800 followers, with regular updates and live videos around event time. They maintain an Instagram account (posting runway highlights, designer features with hashtags like #FWG2023), and utilize Twitter and YouTube for broader reach (event footage is uploaded to YouTube). During the lead-up and the event days, they post daily content and interact with fans. This multi-channel, award-winning platform fosters a vibrant online community year-round.","Well-designed informational website. FWG operates an official website (fashionweekendgambia.gm) which provides history, team info, event schedules, designer line-ups, and galleries. The site is professional and gives a comprehensive overview of the event’s purpose (supporting emerging designers since 2012). It’s kept up-to-date with each year’s show details (e.g. 2023 show schedule and participants). While the site doesn’t handle ticket sales, it serves as a polished reference hub. (Score 9 reflects a regularly updated site, though certain sections like live ticketing or post-event e-commerce are not present.)","Outstanding visuals. As a fashion showcase, FWG generates high-quality visual content. They feature professional runway photography, stylized designer lookbook images, and slick after-movies. The branding is consistent across social media and their site. From model shots to video reels, everything is shot with professional equipment and edited well – capturing the glamour of the event. This visual output not only markets the event but also provides content to designers and media, amplifying its reach.","FWG has an excellent online profile. It is arguably the most talked-about fashion event in Gambia online, so searching its name yields the official site, active social pages, and plenty of related content (articles, videos). It has coverage on international fashion blogs and local news. Because it engages international audiences, it’s optimized for search. With its unique name and consistent presence since 2012, it essentially “owns” its search keywords. There’s also positive buzz and recognition (e.g. being described as Gambia’s biggest fashion event). All these factors contribute to dominant search presence.","Partial digital ticketing. Fashion Weekend Gambia’s tickets or passes are usually sold through partner outlets or at the venue. They often announce on Facebook how to get tickets (or reserve via phone). In recent editions, they have experimented with online RSVPs or Eventbrite-style forms, but an integrated online ticket purchase system is not fully in place. We give 2 points because they do leverage digital channels for ticket inquiries and VIP table bookings (e.g. via messaging or Google Forms), but payment is offline.","FWG is a specific event and not typically listed on year-round tourism platforms (aside from occasional event calendars). Its integration is mainly through its own channels. It collaborates with various sponsors and media (e.g. Paradise TV live-streams parts of it on Facebook), but it’s not a permanent listing on something like TripAdvisor. It could improve by tying into Gambia’s tourism calendar officially. As of now, the integration is limited to the fashion industry networks (e.g. featured on the African fashion circuit and mentioned by cultural organizations).",,https://www.facebook.com/FashionWeekendGambia/,https://www.instagram.com/fashionweekendgambia/?hl=en,,
