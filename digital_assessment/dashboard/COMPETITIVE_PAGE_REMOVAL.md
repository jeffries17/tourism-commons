# Competitive Analysis Page Removal

## Overview
Removed the `/competitive` page from the dashboard to streamline the navigation and reduce redundancy.

## Rationale

### Why Remove?

1. **Conceptual Overlap**: Had two "regional competitive" pages:
   - `/region` - Digital capability comparison (websites, social media, tech)
   - `/competitive` - Sentiment comparison (reviews, themes, ratings)
   - Decision-makers don't need both views

2. **Actionability Gap**:
   - Digital capability gaps ‚Üí specific actions (build website, setup GMB, etc.)
   - Sentiment gaps ‚Üí less clear actions ("be more like Nigeria on service theme"?)
   - `/region` is significantly more actionable

3. **Best Practices Duplication**:
   - `/competitive` had "Learning from top performers"
   - `/region` now has filterable best practices gallery with "how to copy" guidance
   - No need for two implementations

4. **Sentiment Coverage**:
   - `/reviews-sentiment` already handles sentiment analysis for Gambian stakeholders
   - Internal view is more useful for stakeholders than regional comparison

### What Was Lost (and Mitigation)

**Theme Analysis** (service, location, value, staff):
- Interesting but not super actionable
- Could be added to `/reviews-sentiment` if needed in future

**Country Sentiment Rankings**:
- Gambia ranked #2 in West Africa (behind Nigeria)
- **Mitigation**: Added regional context banner to `/reviews-sentiment`

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Route (`App.tsx`)
```typescript
// REMOVED:
import CompetitiveAnalysis from './pages/CompetitiveAnalysis';
<Route path="/competitive" element={<CompetitiveAnalysis />} />
```

### 2. Removed Navigation Link (`Header.tsx`)
```typescript
// REMOVED:
<Link to="/competitive" className="...">
  Competitive Analysis
</Link>
```

### 3. Deleted File
- Deleted: `src/pages/CompetitiveAnalysis.tsx`

### 4. Added Regional Context to Reviews Page (`ReviewsSentiment.tsx`)
```typescript
// ADDED:
<div className="mb-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-emerald-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 rounded-lg p-4">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <div className="text-2xl">üåç</div>
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Regional Context</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
        Gambia ranks <strong className="text-green-700">#2 in West Africa</strong> for visitor sentiment, 
        demonstrating strong service quality and guest experiences across the creative tourism sector.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Resulting Navigation Structure

**Main Pages:**
1. **Dashboard** - Overview and key metrics
2. **Participants** - Individual organization details
3. **Sectors** - Sector-level analysis
4. **Region** - Digital capability comparison (West Africa)
5. **ITO Perception** - Industry perception analysis
6. **Reviews & Sentiment** - Visitor feedback analysis (with regional context)
7. **Methodology** - Assessment methodology

**Removed:**
- ~~Competitive Analysis~~ (redundant with Region + Reviews & Sentiment)

---

## Data Sources

Pages now use:
- `/region` ‚Üí `dashboard_region_data.json` (digital capability)
- `/reviews-sentiment` ‚Üí `sentiment_data.json` (Gambia stakeholder reviews)
- ~~`/competitive`~~ ‚Üí ~~`comparative_sentiment_data.json`~~ (no longer used in UI)

**Note**: `comparative_sentiment_data.json` can be retained for potential future use or data analysis, but it's no longer rendered in the dashboard UI.

---

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Navigation**: One less item in header, easier to find what you need
2. **Focused Messaging**: Each page has a clear, distinct purpose
3. **More Actionable**: Digital capability gaps are easier to address than sentiment gaps
4. **No Lost Value**: Regional ranking preserved in Reviews & Sentiment page
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: One less page to update and maintain

## Future Considerations

If stakeholders request theme-level sentiment analysis (e.g., "How do we perform on service quality themes?"):
- Can add a "Theme Analysis" section to `/reviews-sentiment`
- Can show Gambia's performance across themes (service, location, value, staff, cleanliness)
- Can link theme performance to specific quotes from reviews

If stakeholders want detailed regional sentiment comparison:
- Can create a downloadable report from `comparative_sentiment_data.json`
- Can add a "Download Regional Sentiment Report" button to `/reviews-sentiment`
