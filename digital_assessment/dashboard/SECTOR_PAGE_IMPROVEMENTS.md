# Sector Page Improvements

## Overview
Refined the individual sector detail pages to reduce visual clutter while maintaining all key information.

## Changes Made

### âœ… Kept All Essential Sections

The sector detail page maintains these core sections:
1. **External/Survey/Combined Scores** - 4-tile grid showing key metrics vs overall
2. **Category Comparison vs Overall** - Bar chart comparing sector averages to overall performance
3. **Sector Strengths & Growth Opportunities** - Side-by-side cards highlighting where sector excels and where to improve
4. **Baseline Presence & Reach** - Comprehensive digital footprint analysis
5. **Common Patterns & Platform Adoption** - 3-tile grid showing platform usage statistics
6. **Maturity Mix + Ranked Participants** - Distribution visualization and sortable table

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Improvement: Consolidated Social Reach

**Before:**
- 5 separate large boxes for each platform (Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor, YouTube, TikTok)
- Each box showed: avg followers/reviews, stakeholder count, and total
- Total: 5 tiles taking significant vertical space

**After:**
- **Compact Summary Grid** (5 small tiles)
  - Shows total reach per platform
  - Displays average underneath
  - Color-coded with gradients matching platform brand colors
  - Much smaller footprint (~40% of previous size)

- **Stacked Bar Chart** 
  - Single horizontal bar showing proportional contribution of each platform
  - Visual comparison of where the sector's reach is concentrated
  - Legend and tooltip for detailed numbers
  - Combined total displayed below chart

**Benefits:**
- Reduced from 5 large boxes to 5 compact tiles + 1 chart
- Better visual comparison between platforms
- Maintains all the same data points
- More scannable and less overwhelming
- Professional, data-driven presentation

## Visual Structure

The refined sector page now flows as:

```
1. Back Link
2. Header (Sector name, participant count, avg score)
3. Key Stats Grid (4 tiles: External, Survey, Combined, Completion)
4. Comparison Chart (Sector vs Overall Performance)
5. Strengths & Growth Opportunities (2 side-by-side cards)
6. Sector Baseline
   - Digital Presence (6 platform tiles)
   - Social Media Reach (CONSOLIDATED)
     â””â”€ Compact summary tiles (5)
     â””â”€ Stacked bar chart (1)
   - Common Patterns (3 tiles)
   - Baseline Insights (callout box)
7. Maturity Distribution (4+ tiles)
8. All Participants Table (ranked, sortable)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/sections/SectorBaseline.tsx`
  - Added recharts import for BarChart
  - Replaced large box grid with compact summary + stacked bar
  - Maintained all data points and calculations
  - Added platform-specific brand colors (#1877f2 for Facebook, #E4405F for Instagram, etc.)

### Chart Configuration:
- **Layout:** Horizontal (layout="vertical" for the bar)
- **Stack:** All platforms in single bar (stackId="a")
- **Colors:** Platform brand colors for instant recognition
- **Tooltip:** Shows formatted numbers with commas
- **Total:** Calculated and displayed below chart

### Responsive Design:
- Compact tiles: 2 columns on mobile, 5 on desktop
- Chart: Fully responsive with ResponsiveContainer
- Grid layout collapses gracefully on smaller screens

## Data Displayed

All original metrics are preserved:
- Total followers/subscribers/reviews per platform
- Average per stakeholder
- Number of stakeholders with data for each platform
- Combined sector reach (sum of all platforms)
- Visual proportions via stacked bar

## Benefits

âœ… **Reduced Clutter:** 5 large boxes â†’ 5 compact tiles + 1 visualization  
âœ… **Better Comparison:** Stacked bar shows proportional reach at a glance  
âœ… **Maintained Data:** All numbers still available  
âœ… **Professional Design:** Data-driven visualization instead of box grid  
âœ… **Faster Scanning:** Users can quickly see which platforms dominate  
âœ… **Consistent Style:** Matches other chart visualizations in the dashboard  

## User Experience

Users can now:
1. Quickly see total reach numbers in compact tiles
2. Understand platform distribution via stacked bar
3. Hover for detailed tooltips
4. Compare relative platform importance visually
5. Get exact numbers without overwhelming detail

The page is now more focused, professional, and easier to navigate while maintaining all the analytical depth.
