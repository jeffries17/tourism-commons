There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Senegal at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS), which is around a 40 minute drive from the hotel. Our welcome meeting will take place on the morning of day two at 8.30am. The hotel features a swimming pool and gardens as well as well appointed modern rooms. Accommodation: Hotel Keparanga (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Meals Provided: None Day 2 - Drive into Dakar, ferry to Goree. Explore the historic Goree Island After breakfast this morning, we'll meet with our tour leader for a welcome meeting. Then, we'll head north to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, to catch the ferry to Isle de Goree, a small peaceful, traffic-free island. The crossing takes around 30 minutes. On arrival, we'll drop off our luggage and head out for a walking tour. A busy trading centre during the 18th and 19th centuries, the island of Goree is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its charming colonial-style houses, wrought iron balconies and narrow streets filled with brightly coloured bougainvillaea, you could kid yourself you've been transported back in time as we wander the islands streets and explore. Lunch is included today at a local restaurant. After lunch we'll continue our tour of the island including a visit to Le Castel, a castle situated on a rocky plateau as well as the old Slave House, originally built in 1786. This evening is free to relax at our hotel on the island. Accommodation: Hotel Madou (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Swimming pool available Meals Provided: Breakfast & Lunch Day 3 - Drive to the old French capital of West Africa, St. Louis This morning, we'll catch the ferry back to the mainland and then have a short tour of the capital by bus before continuing north for around five hours to St. Louis. We will stop of a picnic lunch enroute. Once the French capital of West Africa, St Louis is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - it's a colourful, charming city, moving to the rhythm of the local jazz musicians. The streets of St. Louis are narrow, dusty and easy to navigate, lined with crumbling old French-style villas. After checking into our hotel for the next two nights we'll explore this marvellous old town by calesh (horse-drawn carriage) with a local guide. Full of 19th-century French colonial buildings, this was the first French settlement in Africa and the Headquarters of Senegambia (the term used to describe the whole region). By the late 18th century, St Louis was a busy port and trading centre and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000. For dinner, you might like to try the local dish, Thieboudienne, a mix of fish, tomato, rice and vegetable. Accommodation: Hotel Sindone (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Meals Provided: Breakfast & Lunch Day 4 - Visit Djoudj bird reserve and Langue de Barbarie National Park by motorised pirogue This morning, we'll have an early start to visit Djoudj National Park, regarded as one of the most important wetland bird reserves in West Africa. This national park provides the first major water source for migratory birds after their long and gruelling flight over the Sahara Desert. We'll travel by motorised boat along the complex network of channels which lead off the Senegal River. The bird count reaches millions, some species are prevalent such as pelicans - there are as many as 15,000 in the park. We might see them performing an amazing display of synchronised diving for fish and will see a breeding colony. Around three million birds pass through the park annually which includes 400 different species - including herons, white-breasted cormorants, spoonbills, jacanas, Egyptian geese, West African fish eagles and flamingos to name but a few. You might also spot crocodiles, wild hogs, monitor lizards and water pythons. This afternoon we'll visit the Langue de Barbarie National Park, located on a thin sandspit in the estuary of the Senegal River, and home to water birds such as flamingos, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets and ducks. During the months from November to April, the park also fills with many more migratory birds from Europe. We should get back to our hotel around 7pm, dinner is included at our hotel tonight. Accommodation: Hotel Sindone (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Meals Provided: Breakfast & Dinner Day 5 - Drive to Kaolack, visiting the majestic mosque in Touba Early this morning, we'll begin our journey south. We'll break up the first leg of this journey with a visit to an astounding mosque in Touba, the sacred focus of the Mouride Islamic Brotherhood. Their founder Amadou Bamba, Senegal's most famous and influential 'marabout' (holy man), is buried here and pilgrims visit the town all year round, and as we pass through on a Friday, the Mosque will be busy with worshippers. Continuing to Kaolack, Senegal's second largest city, we will make a visit to its thriving local market and salt mining area. The rest of the afternoon is free to relax at our hotel. The total driving time today is around six hours. Accommodation: Le Relais de Kaolack (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Swimming pool available Meals Provided: Breakfast & Dinner Day 6 - Travel to Georgetown (Gambia), visit the Wassau Stone Circles It's around an hour and a half to the Senegal - Gambia border. After completing border formalities we head east, following the route of the river towards Georgetown which was an important administrative centre during the colonial period. Along the way today, we'll visit the Wassu Stone Circles. There are several circles each consisting of about 10 to 24, reddish-brown stones between 1 and 2.5 metres/3.2 and 8.2 feet high and weighing several tons. These were once burial sites dating back to 500 to 1000 AD, however very little is known about the people who were buried here and the stones still present a mystery to archaeologists. On arrive in Georgetown we'll take a short tour of the historical town which is built on an island in the river. Our accommodation this evening is a simple riverside camp made up of simple rondavels with basic ensuite facilities. There is no mains electricity but we'll have limited power from solar-charged panels. There is also no hot water, however, the fantastic location is well worth the trade-off as we get to fall asleep to the sounds of monkeys and birds in the nature that surrounds us. Accommodation: Laminkoto Camp (or similar) Grade: Simple Rondavels Single room available Meals Provided: Breakfast & Dinner Day 7 - Full day cruise along the Gambia River The Gambia River flows along the entire length of the country for 483 kilometres/300 miles from east to west into the Atlantic Ocean and the banks of the river have been inhabited since 2000 BC. We'll spend the next two days on this mighty waterway, cruising downstream in a converted groundnut boat, passing tropical forest, bamboo groves, rice paddies and mangrove swamps. Amongst the varied fauna present in this area are monkeys, hippos, crocodiles and of course a great number of bird species. We'll spend one overnight on board a motor cruiser. Facilities on board are very simple with a Western-style toilet, a small kitchen and a bar. At night, we'll sleep in a communal setting on the upper deck on mattresses, and the daytime can be spent relaxing on the upper deck in the sun or on the lower deck with seating in the shade. Accommodation: Gambia Motorcruiser (or similar) Grade: Simple Boat Single Room Unavailable Meals Provided: Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 8 - Bird and wildlife spotting as we continue to cruise down the Gambia River; late afternoon drive to Bintang Bolong This morning, we'll continue our gentle cruise downstream, with time to take in the flora and wildlife along the riverbanks. The crew will put together lunch on the boat before arriving in the small settlement of Tendaba on the Gambia's south bank in the late afternoon. On arrival, we'll leave our boat and drive to a lodge on the banks of a tributary of the Gambia River at Bintang Bolong and check in to our riverfront accommodation. The setting of our lodge is spectacular, it's a great chance to explore the natural surroundings spotting the resident birdlife from the restaurant terrace. In the evening, apes and vultures inhabit the overwhelming Baobab trees, and after dusk, great colonies of fruit bats can be seen swarming into the night. Accommodation: AbCa's Creek Lodge (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Lodge Single room available Meals Provided: Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 9 - Morning in the Bintang Bolong river basin. Travel to the coast. We'll spend this morning in the river basin around Bintang Bolong. The lodge is located in the middle of a mangrove forest which offers fantastic wildlife viewing opportunities, in particular for those with a keen interest in birdwatching. The rich habitat supports a huge range of birds, including kingfishers, egrets parrots, hornbills, lapwings and herons in abundance. Birdlife is at its most active in the mornings, we'll start the day with an early morning boat trip to spot wildlife on the banks of the river including three species of monkeys, and at low tide, crocodiles and lizards. This afternoon we drive to the Gambia coast for a night on the golden sand beaches of the Atlantic.

Along the way, we might be lucky enough to spot pelicans and flamingos. After a packed lunch onboard, we'll arrive in Ndangane, our destination for tonight where the afternoon will be free to absorb the slower pace of life. Ndangane is a small fishing village often used as a base along the Delta, the beach is lined with traditional pirogues and along the main stretch of road, there is a small number of bars and craft shops. Accommodation: Le Pelican Hotel (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Rondavels Single room available Swimming pool available Meals Provided: Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 12 - Visit Senegal's giant Baobab tree, explore Fadiout Island and return to Saly Today, we'll depart Saloum Delta National Park to begin our journey back to Dakar. Our first stop, just a short time away is to see a giant Baobab tree. Baobab trees are the national symbol of Senegal, some trees dating back 6,000 years and can only be found in a few places around the world. We'll have a short stop here before we continue. Our next stop will be for a guided walking tour Fadiout Islands. This unusual destination is composed of oysters and clam shells, and the inhabitants are both Muslim and Christian who all live together peacefully. The Christian and Muslim cemeteries are built on a huge ancient shell mound and our guide will take us around to help us understand this very unique community. Later this afternoon, we'll continue our return journey to Saly, arriving in time for dinner. Accommodation: Hotel Keparanga (or similar) Grade: Comfortable Hotel Single room available Meals Provided: Breakfast Day 13 - Trip ends in Saly The trip ends after breakfast at our hotel in Saly, close to the airport. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to depart from Dakar at any time. If your flight is departing later in the day, luggage storage facilities are available at our hotel. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS), which is around a 40 minute from the hotel. Meals Provided: Breakfast Is this the tour for you? We've graded the pace of this trip as moderate, expect a busy itinerary balanced with free time to relax or explore solo. Our aim is to get off the beaten path and we'll have a couple of longer drives along the way in Senegal. These give us a chance to soak up the stunning scenery and explore the interior of the country. Senegal is an incredibly welcoming destination but it's worth noting that accommodation and service standards differ from those back home. Restaurant service can be quite slow and accommodation might be on the basic side. It goes without saying that it can get very hot in West Africa. We recommend packing light layers and carrying sun protection and water at all times. We use a mixture of international standard hotels and lodges. There is one night where facilities on board the boat on the Gambia River are very simple with a western - style toilet, a small kitchen and a bar. Food options are quite limited in West Africa and while vegetarians can be catered for, choice will be limited. Senegalese food also uses nuts extensively, so those with allergies will find dining options difficult. Trip information Climate and country information Senegal Climate Senegal’s tropical climate is split into two periods: The dry season features temperatures in the mid-20s centigrade which can rise to 35 degrees between November to April. The Harmattan is a dry wind which blows from the north, usually from December-February, and evening can feel much cooler during this time. The green (rainy) season of the African monsoon is between June to October, with more rainfall in the south as it heads northwards. Days can alternate between hot and dry and wet and damp, with average temperatures between high-20s to low-30s. Humidity is higher and temperatures lower along the coastal areas, while temperatures inland fall at night. Average sunshine hours per day ranges from 8-10 hours between October to May. Time difference to GMT 0 Plugs You will need a power plug travel adapter for sockets type C, D, E and K in Senegal. Take a multi plug adaptor. Religion Islam, Christian Language French The Gambia Climate The Gambia has a tropical climate which features the green and dry seasons. The green season between mid-June to mid-October sees the annual rains which transforms the dry land into lush green areas. Average temperatures during the green season are in the low-30s with high humidity and more rainfall in the south. The dry season between late-October to May has average temperatures of between high-20s to mid-30s centigrade with sunny days. Humidity is higher though the temperatures are lower on the coast, and temperatures inland fall at night. Average daily sunshine hours between October to May ranges from 6 to10 hours. The Harmattan is a dry wind which blows from the north, usually from December to February. Time difference to GMT 0 Plugs 3 Pin Flat Religion Islam Language English Budgeting and packing Optional activities The following excursions and/or activities are usually available and may be arranged locally. Estimated costs are provided below for guidance only, are on a per person basis unless shown otherwise, and may depend on the number of participants. Prices quoted are correct as of the date these tour notes were originally issued but may change at any time due to currency fluctuations. Please note: These activities are booked and paid for locally and do not form part of your Explore holiday contract. Saloum Delta (Senegal): Bird watching trip, Approx. Cfa10,000 per person (est. GBP15 per person) Payment by cash preferred Clothing Pack essentially for hot conditions. Light cotton clothing is recommended plus protective headgear in case of strong winds. A light fleece is advisable for cool nights. Long sleeved shirt and trousers help give protection against mosquitoes try avoiding dark colours. A wide-brimmed sun hat is useful for protection during boat trips and sunglasses. Please note: Senegambia is predominantly Muslim and women will need a headscarf plus a full length skirt or sarong for visiting the mosque in Touba. Footwear Comfortable shoes and sandals. Luggage 20kg Luggage: On tour One main piece of baggage (a soft bag/holdall or rucksack) and a daysac , total allowance: 44lb/20kg. Remember you are expected to carry your own baggage in and out of hotels - so we recommend you pack light. Equipment Take a sleeping sheet for the Gambia accommodation as it is basic. Sheets and blankets are provided for the river cruise. Binoculars for bird watching and game viewing, a small torch, insect repellent, water bottle and swimwear. A mosquito net may come in useful - many hotels are close to water and although hotels have nets on the windows and over the beds, these are not always 100% effective. Tipping Explore leader Tipping isn't compulsory, and we work hard to ensure that our leaders all receive a fair wage. However, you might want to recognise a leader that's done a great job or really added to your trip by giving them a tip. We're often asked about the recommended amount. It's a tricky one, and down to personal preference, but we'd recommend between £20 to £25 per person per week as a guideline. Local crew Although entirely voluntary, tipping is a recognized part of life in this region of the world. Some local staff will look to members of the group for personal recognition of particular services provided. In order to make things easier for you, your leader may organise a group's tips kitty for included activities and meals and if this is the case, they will account for it throughout the tour. Accordingly, you should allow £45 per person for group tipping. Senegal Food and drink The costs for meals may vary depending upon location, type of restaurant and number of courses eaten and so the prices given are an average guide. Local restaurants located off the beaten track may be less expensive, whereas an upmarket restaurant located in the centre of a major city may charge more.

Transport, Accommodation, Food & Drink Transport Information Bus, 4WD, Boat Accommodation notes Senegal's tourism infrastructure is well-developed and standards are generally good throughout the country. We stay in a selection of properties ranging between simple guesthouses and comfortable hotels chosen for their location or authenticity. All properties feature hot water and electricity but as with many countries in West Africa, Senegal is subject to low water pressure and outages at any time. Gambia's tourism infrastructure is far less developed. Hot water and electricity are unreliable. Standards of service can vary greatly and waiting times for simple requests can be lengthy but staff are welcoming and friendly. We stay in two different eco-camps, located on the riverbank. Electricity is only available between set hours and can be temperamental, and hot water can also be unreliable. The rural location of both camps offers excellent bird spotting opportunities as well as a great place to watch sunsets along the river or sit under clear skies without light pollution. We also spend one night aboard a simple boat with basic facilities. There is one Western-style WC, a small kitchen and a bar. Sleeping arrangements are under the stars on the upper deck. Thick mattresses cover the deck to create a communal sleeping area, with mosquito nets provided at night. During the daytime, you can relax under the sunshade or on the lower deck where there is comfortable seating. Mosquito nets are provided on all nights of the tour except in Dakar and the Saloum Delta National Park. Food and drink Food option will be more limited in West Africa. Lunch and dinners are typically a combination of chicken or fish with vegetables in season and rice or potatoes. Please note that there are no fast food outlets, it can take some time to prepare meals, especially in more rural areas. Vegetarians can be catered for, but the variety will be very limited at times. Nuts are used extensively in dishes throughout West Africa, if you have a nut allergy, please discuss this with us prior to booking. Senegal Food and drink Can you drink the water? The water quality is poor and therefore it is recommended to avoid drinking tap water during your trip. The Gambia Food and drink Can you drink the water? The water quality is poor and therefore it is recommended to avoid drinking tap water during your trip.

Once the French capital of West Africa, St Louis is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - it's a colourful, charming city, moving to the rhythm of the local jazz musicians. The streets of St. Louis are narrow, dusty and easy to navigate, lined with crumbling old French-style villas. After checking into our hotel for the next two nights we'll explore this marvellous old town by calesh (horse-drawn carriage) with a local guide. Full of 19th-century French colonial buildings, this was the first French settlement in Africa and the Headquarters of Senegambia (the term used to describe the whole region). By the late 18th century, St Louis was a busy port and trading centre and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000.

We'll travel by motorised boat along the complex network of channels which lead off the Senegal River. The bird count reaches millions, some species are prevalent such as pelicans - there are as many as 15,000 in the park.

Around three million birds pass through the park annually which includes 400 different species - including herons, white-breasted cormorants, spoonbills, jacanas, Egyptian geese, West African fish eagles and flamingos to name but a few. You might also spot crocodiles, wild hogs, monitor lizards and water pythons. This afternoon we'll visit the Langue de Barbarie National Park, located on a thin sandspit in the estuary of the Senegal River, and home to water birds such as flamingos, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets and ducks.

Our accommodation this evening is a simple riverside camp made up of simple rondavels with basic ensuite facilities. There is no mains electricity but we'll have limited power from solar-charged panels.

We'll spend the next two days on this mighty waterway, cruising downstream in a converted groundnut boat, passing tropical forest, bamboo groves, rice paddies and mangrove swamps. Amongst the varied fauna present in this area are monkeys, hippos, crocodiles and of course a great number of bird species. We'll spend one overnight on board a motor cruiser. Facilities on board are very simple with a Western-style toilet, a small kitchen and a bar.

Our next stop will be for a guided walking tour Fadiout Islands. This unusual destination is composed of oysters and clam shells, and the inhabitants are both Muslim and Christian who all live together peacefully.

If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS), which is around a 40 minute from the hotel. Meals Provided: Breakfast Is this the tour for you? We've graded the pace of this trip as moderate, expect a busy itinerary balanced with free time to relax or explore solo. Our aim is to get off the beaten path and we'll have a couple of longer drives along the way in Senegal. These give us a chance to soak up the stunning scenery and explore the interior of the country. Senegal is an incredibly welcoming destination but it's worth noting that accommodation and service standards differ from those back home. Restaurant service can be quite slow and accommodation might be on the basic side. It goes without saying that it can get very hot in West Africa. We recommend packing light layers and carrying sun protection and water at all times. We use a mixture of international standard hotels and lodges. There is one night where facilities on board the boat on the Gambia River are very simple with a western - style toilet, a small kitchen and a bar. Food options are quite limited in West Africa and while vegetarians can be catered for, choice will be limited. Senegalese food also uses nuts extensively, so those with allergies will find dining options difficult. Trip information Climate and country information Senegal Climate Senegal’s tropical climate is split into two periods: The dry season features temperatures in the mid-20s centigrade which can rise to 35 degrees between November to April. The Harmattan is a dry wind which blows from the north, usually from December-February, and evening can feel much cooler during this time. The green (rainy) season of the African monsoon is between June to October, with more rainfall in the south as it heads northwards. Days can alternate between hot and dry and wet and damp, with average temperatures between high-20s to low-30s. Humidity is higher and temperatures lower along the coastal areas, while temperatures inland fall at night. Average sunshine hours per day ranges from 8-10 hours between October to May. Time difference to GMT 0 Plugs You will need a power plug travel adapter for sockets type C, D, E and K in Senegal. Take a multi plug adaptor. Religion Islam, Christian Language French The Gambia Climate The Gambia has a tropical climate which features the green and dry seasons. The green season between mid-June to mid-October sees the annual rains which transforms the dry land into lush green areas. Average temperatures during the green season are in the low-30s with high humidity and more rainfall in the south. The dry season between late-October to May has average temperatures of between high-20s to mid-30s centigrade with sunny days. Humidity is higher though the temperatures are lower on the coast, and temperatures inland fall at night. Average daily sunshine hours between October to May ranges from 6 to10 hours. The Harmattan is a dry wind which blows from the north, usually from December to February. Time difference to GMT 0 Plugs 3 Pin Flat Religion Islam Language English Budgeting and packing Optional activities The following excursions and/or activities are usually available and may be arranged locally. Estimated costs are provided below for guidance only, are on a per person basis unless shown otherwise, and may depend on the number of participants. Prices quoted are correct as of the date these tour notes were originally issued but may change at any time due to currency fluctuations. Please note: These activities are booked and paid for locally and do not form part of your Explore holiday contract. Saloum Delta (Senegal): Bird watching trip, Approx. Cfa10,000 per person (est. GBP15 per person) Payment by cash preferred Clothing Pack essentially for hot conditions. Light cotton clothing is recommended plus protective headgear in case of strong winds. A light fleece is advisable for cool nights. Long sleeved shirt and trousers help give protection against mosquitoes try avoiding dark colours. A wide-brimmed sun hat is useful for protection during boat trips and sunglasses. Please note: Senegambia is predominantly Muslim and women will need a headscarf plus a full length skirt or sarong for visiting the mosque in Touba. Footwear Comfortable shoes and sandals. Luggage 20kg Luggage: On tour One main piece of baggage (a soft bag/holdall or rucksack) and a daysac , total allowance: 44lb/20kg. Remember you are expected to carry your own baggage in and out of hotels - so we recommend you pack light. Equipment Take a sleeping sheet for the Gambia accommodation as it is basic. Sheets and blankets are provided for the river cruise. Binoculars for bird watching and game viewing, a small torch, insect repellent, water bottle and swimwear. A mosquito net may come in useful - many hotels are close to water and although hotels have nets on the windows and over the beds, these are not always 100% effective. Tipping Explore leader Tipping isn't compulsory, and we work hard to ensure that our leaders all receive a fair wage. However, you might want to recognise a leader that's done a great job or really added to your trip by giving them a tip. We're often asked about the recommended amount. It's a tricky one, and down to personal preference, but we'd recommend between £20 to £25 per person per week as a guideline. Local crew Although entirely voluntary, tipping is a recognized part of life in this region of the world. Some local staff will look to members of the group for personal recognition of particular services provided. In order to make things easier for you, your leader may organise a group's tips kitty for included activities and meals and if this is the case, they will account for it throughout the tour. Accordingly, you should allow £45 per person for group tipping. Senegal Food and drink The costs for meals may vary depending upon location, type of restaurant and number of courses eaten and so the prices given are an average guide. Local restaurants located off the beaten track may be less expensive, whereas an upmarket restaurant located in the centre of a major city may charge more. Lunch price £14 Dinner price £22 Beer price £4.0 Water price £1.6 Foreign Exchange Local currency CFA Franc. Recommended Currency For Exchange Euros cash.

Transport, Accommodation, Food & Drink Transport Information Bus, 4WD, Boat Accommodation notes Senegal's tourism infrastructure is well-developed and standards are generally good throughout the country. We stay in a selection of properties ranging between simple guesthouses and comfortable hotels chosen for their location or authenticity. All properties feature hot water and electricity but as with many countries in West Africa, Senegal is subject to low water pressure and outages at any time. Gambia's tourism infrastructure is far less developed. Hot water and electricity are unreliable. Standards of service can vary greatly and waiting times for simple requests can be lengthy but staff are welcoming and friendly. We stay in two different eco-camps, located on the riverbank. Electricity is only available between set hours and can be temperamental, and hot water can also be unreliable. The rural location of both camps offers excellent bird spotting opportunities as well as a great place to watch sunsets along the river or sit under clear skies without light pollution. We also spend one night aboard a simple boat with basic facilities. There is one Western-style WC, a small kitchen and a bar. Sleeping arrangements are under the stars on the upper deck. Thick mattresses cover the deck to create a communal sleeping area, with mosquito nets provided at night. During the daytime, you can relax under the sunshade or on the lower deck where there is comfortable seating. Mosquito nets are provided on all nights of the tour except in Dakar and the Saloum Delta National Park. Food and drink Food option will be more limited in West Africa. Lunch and dinners are typically a combination of chicken or fish with vegetables in season and rice or potatoes. Please note that there are no fast food outlets, it can take some time to prepare meals, especially in more rural areas. Vegetarians can be catered for, but the variety will be very limited at times. Nuts are used extensively in dishes throughout West Africa, if you have a nut allergy, please discuss this with us prior to booking. Senegal Food and drink Can you drink the water? The water quality is poor and therefore it is recommended to avoid drinking tap water during your trip. The Gambia Food and drink Can you drink the water? The water quality is poor and therefore it is recommended to avoid drinking tap water during your trip.
