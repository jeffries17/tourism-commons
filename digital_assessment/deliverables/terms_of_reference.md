The Gambia Tourism Digital Assessment

Background
The International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization specializing in trade-related technical cooperation for developing countries. Its Strategies and
Policies for Trade and Investment (SPTI) section provides technical support for the design and
management of national trade development roadmaps and export strategies.
The EU Youth Empowerment Project (YEP) Tourism and Creative Industries initiative aims to enhance the
competitiveness, inclusiveness, and sustainability of The Gambia's tourism sector. The project seeks to
create and sustain jobs, generate income, and provide economic incentives for climate change adaptation
and green growth, with a primary focus on women, youth, and vulnerable groups. It emphasizes creating
quality jobs, fostering skills development, and supporting business growth and sustainability. Specifically,
the project addresses sector challenges to:
a) improve the business environment and institutional ecosystem for tourism and creative industries,
b) foster investment and market access for these sectors, and
c) enhance MSME competitiveness within tourism and creative industries.
As part of this project, ITC’s SPTI section will assist the Government of The Gambia in designing two
sector roadmaps. These roadmaps are intended to boost export competitiveness and diversification. The
ITC-facilitated roadmap design process enables countries to:
● Address competitiveness challenges, seize opportunities, and improve sector performance.
● Align sector interventions with national planning frameworks and donor programs.
Mobilize national and international partners to support the sector, identify synergies in development
initiatives, and improve coordination among public and private sectors and development agencies.
●
Support MSMEs and relevant institutions in integrating into global and regional supply chains and
accessing new markets.
●
To support the ITC team in designing the sector roadmaps for tourism and creative industries, ITC will
retain the services of an International Consultant (Digital Assessment). This consultant will assist ITC’s
SPTI section, within the Division of Market Development (DMD), in conducting a digital assessment and
market analysis as part of the tourism sector diagnostic.
