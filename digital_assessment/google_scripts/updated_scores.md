## SECTOR-SPECIFIC WEIGHTING

The standardized 10-point base system allows for flexible weighting across different business sectors while maintaining consistent, measurable criteria. Each sector receives 70 total points, but the distribution reflects their unique digital priorities and customer engagement patterns.

### Creative Industries (Artists, Musicians, Craftspeople)
1. Social Media Business Presence - 31% (22/70 points)
2. Visual Content Quality - 29% (20/70 points)
3. Website Presence & Functionality - 14% (10/70 points)
4. Online Discoverability & Reputation - 11% (8/70 points)
5. Digital Sales/Booking Capability - 7% (5/70 points)
6. Platform Integration - 7% (5/70 points)

Creative professionals rely heavily on visual storytelling and social media platforms as their primary sales channels. Their work IS visual content, making social media presence and visual quality the most critical factors for business success. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook are where customers discover and purchase their work, while professional presentation directly impacts sales. Website presence serves more as a portfolio showcase than a primary sales channel. Discoverability through search engines is less critical since customers typically find them through social media or word-of-mouth. Digital sales capabilities are minimal because most transactions involve custom work negotiated directly, and platform integration with tourism directories is least important since they often serve local markets rather than tourists.

### Tour Operators
1. Online Discoverability & Reputation - 36% (26/70 points)
2. Website Presence & Functionality - 21% (15/70 points)
3. Social Media Business Presence - 20% (14/70 points)
4. Digital Sales/Booking Capability - 17% (12/70 points)
5. Visual Content Quality - 14% (10/70 points)
6. Platform Integration - 14% (10/70 points)

Tour operators depend on discoverability and booking capabilities as tourists research and plan their trips months in advance. Discoverability through search engines and tourism directories is crucial because tourists actively search for tour options online. Website presence serves as the primary source of detailed information about tours, itineraries, and booking. Digital sales and booking capabilities are essential since tourists expect to book and pay online. Social media plays a supporting role, useful for showcasing experiences and building trust but not the primary discovery channel. Visual content quality is important but not core since they're selling experiences rather than visual products, and platform integration with tourism directories is moderately important for visibility in tourism planning platforms.

This weighting system ensures that the assessment framework remains relevant and fair across different business models while maintaining the same objective, measurable criteria for all sectors.

**Note on Survey Integration (30% of total score):** The remaining 30 points come from self-reported survey data covering digital comfort, content strategy, platform usage, investment capacity, and perceived challenges. This internal assessment component is crucial because how business owners perceive and engage with digital marketing directly impacts their willingness to adopt new tools and strategies. Their self-reported comfort levels, posting frequency, and investment capacity provide essential context for designing targeted interventions and support programs. A business with strong external presence but low digital comfort may need different support than one with high confidence but poor execution.

## Next: Survey-Based Assessment (30 points total)

Now we need to work on the survey-based criteria. These are based on self-reported data, so they might be easier to keep as they are, or we could also break them down into more specific questions...
