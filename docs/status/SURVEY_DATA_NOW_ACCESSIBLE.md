# Survey Data Now Accessible ✅

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Complete and Deployed

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The survey scoring system was working, but only the **total score** was being stored and displayed. The detailed breakdown scores (foundation, capability, growth) and individual component scores were not accessible in the dashboard.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `Survey_Scoring` Sheet
- **Location**: Added new sheet to master spreadsheet
- **Structure**: Comprehensive survey data for all 7 participants
- **Columns**:
  - Participant Name, Type (CI/TO), Survey Date
  - **Total Score** (/30)
  - **Foundation Score** (/10)
  - **Capability Score** (/10)
  - **Growth Score** (/10)
  - **Maturity Tier** (Intermediate, Advanced, etc.)
  - **Maturity Description** (full text explanation)
  - **Detailed Breakdown** (15 individual component scores)

### 2. Updated Backend API
- **File**: `functions/src/app.ts`
- **New Function**: `readSurveyScores()` - Reads from Survey_Scoring sheet
- **Updated Endpoints**:
  - `/participants` - Now includes survey breakdown
  - `/tour-operators` - Now includes survey breakdown
  - `/participant/plan` - Now includes survey breakdown

### 3. Enhanced TypeScript Types
- **File**: `dashboard/src/types/index.ts`
- **Added**: `surveyBreakdown` object with foundation, capability, and growth details
- **Added**: `surveyDescription` field for maturity tier explanation
