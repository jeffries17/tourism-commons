## 🔄 How to Re-Run Analysis (Future)

When new reviews are collected:

```bash
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment/sentiment/scripts
python3 comprehensive_sentiment_analysis.py
```

Then split into dashboard files:
```bash
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment/sentiment/output
python3 << 'EOF'
# (Use splitting script from UNIFIED_THEMES_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
EOF
```

---

## ✅ Verification Commands

Test that everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check dashboard files exist and are valid JSON
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment/dashboard/public
cat sentiment_data.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20
cat tour_operators_sentiment.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20
cat regional_sentiment.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20

# 2. Verify all have 9 themes
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
for file in ['sentiment_data.json', 'tour_operators_sentiment.json', 'regional_sentiment.json']:
    with open(file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    print(f"{file}: {len(data['metadata']['unified_themes'])} themes, {data['metadata']['total_stakeholders']} stakeholders")
EOF

# 3. Start dashboard to test
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment/dashboard
npm run dev
```
