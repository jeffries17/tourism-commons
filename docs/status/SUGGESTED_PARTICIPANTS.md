## üîç RESEARCH NOTES

### Why These Choices?

1. **Mix of institutional and commercial**: Balance between cultural institutions and active businesses
2. **Discoverable online**: Entities likely to have digital presence for analysis
3. **Representative**: Cover different sub-sectors within each category
4. **Active operations**: Prioritized entities known to be currently active
5. **Avoid duplicates**: Confirmed none of these appear in existing participant list

### Confidence Levels Explained

- **High confidence**: Well-known entity, definitely exists, likely has digital presence
- **Medium confidence**: Entity exists, but digital presence uncertain or name may vary
- **Low confidence**: Entity may exist but harder to verify online

### Alternative Strategy

If you prefer **smaller/grassroots organizations** over established ones, I can suggest:
- Local artisan cooperatives
- Emerging fashion designers
- Community cultural centers
- Independent music venues

Just let me know your preference!
