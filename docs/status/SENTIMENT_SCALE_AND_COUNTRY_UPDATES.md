# Sentiment Scale & Country-by-Country Analysis Updates

## Changes Completed - October 10, 2025

### 1. **Clarified Sentiment Scoring (-1 to +1 Scale)**

**Problem:** The dashboard was displaying sentiment scores on a 0-10 scale without explaining that this is a conversion from the standard -1 to +1 sentiment analysis scale.

**Solution:**
- Updated all sentiment displays to show 3 decimal places for precision: `+0.324` instead of `+0.32`
- Added "(-1 to +1)" labels throughout the UI to clarify the scale
- Added an info banner in ThemeComparison component explaining the scale conversion
- Updated column headers in tables to include scale reference

**Files Modified:**
- `dashboard/src/pages/ReviewsSentiment.tsx` - Updated sentiment displays throughout
- `dashboard/src/components/ThemeComparison.tsx` - Added scoring explanation banner

### 2. **Country-by-Country Regional Analysis**

**Problem:** Regional competitor data was only shown as an aggregate average, making it impossible to identify which specific countries were performing better and could serve as benchmarks.

**Solution:**
- Transformed regional sentiment data to preserve country information
- Added interactive country filter pills to the Regional tab
- Shows all 5 countries: Benin, Cape Verde, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal
- Added country-specific statistics:
  - Number of stakeholders per country
  - Total reviews per country
  - Average sentiment per country (-1 to +1 scale)
- Added Country column to stakeholder table when viewing Regional tab
- Dynamic banner that updates based on selected country

**Features:**
- **"All Countries" view**: Shows aggregate statistics with quick comparison cards for all 5 countries
- **Individual country view**: Detailed breakdown when a specific country is selected
- Color-coded country tags in the table for easy identification
- Quick-access country pills with stakeholder counts

**Files Modified:**
- `dashboard/src/pages/ReviewsSentiment.tsx` - Added country filtering UI and logic
- `dashboard/public/regional_sentiment.json` - Updated with country information

**New Scripts:**
- `sentiment/scripts/transform_regional_for_dashboard.py` - Transforms regional data to include country fields

### 3. **Data Quality Improvements**

**Before:**
- Regional data had no country breakdowns
- Sentiment scores displayed as 2 decimal places
- Scale conversion not explained

**After:**
- Full country-by-country breakdown available
- 3 decimal precision for sentiment (e.g., +0.324)
- Clear labeling of -1 to +1 scale throughout
- 45 regional stakeholders across 5 countries:
  - Benin: 7 stakeholders, 446 reviews
  - Cape Verde: 9 stakeholders, 591 reviews
  - Ghana: 12 stakeholders, 823 reviews
  - Nigeria: 10 stakeholders, 576 reviews
  - Senegal: 7 stakeholders, 660 reviews

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**

**Regional Tab Features:**
1. **Country Selector**: Prominent pill-style buttons to switch between countries
2. **Summary Statistics**: Quick-view cards showing sentiment for each country
3. **Detailed View**: When a country is selected, shows full breakdown
