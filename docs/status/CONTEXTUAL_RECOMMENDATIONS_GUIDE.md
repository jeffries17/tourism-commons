# Contextual Recommendations Generator - User Guide

## What's Different?

This new script generates recommendations based on **exactly what participants are missing** in their Checklist Detail assessment, rather than just overall scores.

### Old Approach:
- Looked at aggregate scores (e.g., "Website: 4/10")
- Generated generic recommendations

### New Approach:
- Reads specific criteria they're missing (e.g., "No contact form", "Not mobile-friendly")
- Generates targeted recommendations addressing those exact gaps
- Much more actionable!

## Setup

### 1. Set Your OpenAI API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or add permanently to your shell profile:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment
source regional_analysis_env/bin/activate
```

## Usage

### Test with 1-2 Participants First

```bash
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "African Adventure Tours"
```

Or test multiple:

```bash
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "African Adventure Tours" "Gambia Experience"
```

This will:
1. Read their Checklist Detail data
2. Show you exactly what criteria they're missing (0s vs 1s)
3. Generate personalized recommendations
4. Update the Recommendations sheet

### Example Output

‚úÖ Updated Recommendations sheet for African Adventure Tours
```

## How It Works

### 1. Reads Checklist Detail

The script reads the actual 0/1 scores from the Checklist Detail sheet:

```
Columns F-O: Social Media (10 criteria)
Columns Q-Z: Website (10 criteria)
Columns AB-AK: Visual Content (10 criteria)
Columns AM-AV: Discoverability (10 criteria)
Columns AX-BG: Digital Sales (10 criteria)
Columns BI-BR: Platform Integration (10 criteria)
```

### 2. Identifies Gaps

For each category, it finds criteria with `0` or empty values:

```python
Missing in Social Media:
  - SM4: Posts monthly in last 6 months [0]
  - SM9: Uses platform business features [0]
```

### 3. Generates Targeted Recommendations

The AI prompt includes:
- Business name (for personalization)
- Sector (for context)
- Specific missing criteria (for precision)
- Request for practical, low-cost advice

### 4. Updates Recommendations Sheet

Writes to the same sheet format as before, so the dashboard displays them automatically.

## Cost & Time

- **API Cost**: ~$0.02-0.05 per participant
- **Time**: ~30 seconds per participant
- **Test Mode**: Free (just reads data, minimal API calls)

## Troubleshooting

### "Participant not found"
- Check spelling matches exactly as in Checklist Detail sheet
- Names are case-insensitive but must match

### "No gaps found"
- They have perfect 10/10 scores! No recommendations needed.

### API Errors
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check you have API credits
- Rate limiting is built-in (0.5s between categories)

## Next Steps

1. **Test first**: Try with 1-2 participants
2. **Review quality**: Check if recommendations are specific and helpful  
3. **Adjust as needed**: Modify prompts if recommendations aren't hitting the mark
4. **Scale up**: Once happy, can add `--all` mode to process everyone

**This approach is much better because it tells participants exactly what to fix, not just vague advice!**
