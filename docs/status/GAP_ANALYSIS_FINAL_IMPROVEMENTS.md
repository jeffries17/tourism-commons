## 1. New Introduction Header

### Visual Design
- **Purple gradient header** with white text
- **Two-column explainer** boxes within the header

### Content

**Main Question:**
> "This analysis explores a key question: **Are Gambia's creative sectors being held back by limited digital visibility?**"

**The Theory:**
> "International tour operators rely on digital discovery to find and feature local creative industries. If Gambian cultural sites, artisans, and festivals aren't digitally discoverable (no websites, poor social presence, no online booking), operators may simply *not know they exist* — even if they want to include creative tourism in their packages."

**What We're Comparing:**
- Gambia's Digital Readiness (how mature are organizations?)
- ITO Emphasis in Pure Gambia Tours (standalone demand)
- ITO Emphasis in Regional Packages (regional demand)

**The Insight:**
> "Large gaps reveal sectors where improving digital visibility could unlock inclusion in more tour packages."

## 2. Key Findings Banner

**New Feature:** Dynamic insights showing:

### 🎯 Smallest Gap (Easiest to Focus)
- Automatically identifies the sector with the smallest absolute gap
- **Example:** "Festivals: 8pp avg gap. Already relatively aligned — focus efforts here for quick wins."
- **Color:** Green background
- **Purpose:** Shows which sector is most ready for immediate action

### 📈 Largest Gap (Biggest Opportunity)
- Automatically identifies the sector with the largest absolute gap  
- **Example:** "Heritage: 39pp avg gap. Largest gap — improving digital visibility here could unlock major gains."
- **Color:** Amber background
- **Purpose:** Shows where digital improvements could have biggest impact

**Why This Matters:**
- No longer "all Low Priority"
- Relative comparison across the 7 sectors
- Clear prioritization for stakeholders

---

## 3. Updated Sector Labels

### Before:
```
📈 Digital Readiness
16%
CI Assessment score
```

### After:
```
📈 Gambia Heritage
16%
Digital readiness
```

**Changes:**
- Label now says "Gambia [Sector Short Name]" (e.g., "Gambia Heritage", "Gambia Crafts")
- More intuitive - immediately tells stakeholders what they're looking at
- Subtitle changed from "CI Assessment score" to "Digital readiness"

---

## 4. Highlight Tour Examples

**New Feature:** Each sector card now shows two example tours:

### 🇬🇲 Example: Pure Gambia Tour
- Operator name
- Creative score
- Direct link to tour
- **Source:** `gambia_standalone.best_tours[0]`

### 🌍 Example: Multi-Country Tour
- Operator name
- Creative score  
- Direct link to tour
- **Source:** `top_tours_global` filtered for tours with Gambia + other countries

**Why This Matters:**
- **Tangible references:** Stakeholders can study actual tours
- **Learn from leaders:** See how top operators position sectors
- **Benchmarking:** Understand what "high emphasis" looks like in practice

---

## 5. Sector-Specific Visual Indicators

### Closest Gap Sector (Green)
- **Background:** `bg-green-50 border-green-300`
- **Badge:** "🎯 Focus Opportunity (Smallest Gap)"
- **Meaning:** This sector is already relatively aligned — easiest to focus on

### Furthest Gap Sector (Amber)
- **Background:** `bg-amber-50 border-amber-300`
- **Badge:** "📈 Biggest Opportunity (Largest Gap)"
- **Meaning:** This sector has the largest gap — biggest potential gains from digital improvements

### All Other Sectors (Gray)
- **Background:** `bg-gray-50 border-gray-200`
- **No badge**

---

## 6. Enhanced Gap Calculations

### New Metrics Per Sector:

```javascript
// Gambia-Only Gap
const gambiaOnlyGap = gambiaOnlyEmphasis - digitalReadiness;
// Example: 44% - 16% = +28pp

// Multi-Country Gap
const multiCountryGap = multiCountryEmphasis - digitalReadiness;
// Example: 55% - 16% = +39pp

// Average Gap (for sorting)
const avgGap = (gambiaOnlyGap + multiCountryGap) / 2;
// Example: (28 + 39) / 2 = 33.5pp
```

**Display:**
- Shows gap in percentage points (pp) below each score
- Positive gap (+28pp) = ITO emphasis exceeds readiness → opportunity
- Negative gap (-5pp) = Readiness exceeds ITO emphasis → Hidden Gem

---

## 7. Digital Visibility Opportunity Insight

**New Feature:** Smart recommendations based on gap size

### Small Gap (< 10pp)
> "Small gap (8pp avg). Festivals is relatively well-positioned. Minor digital improvements could close the gap."

### Moderate Gap (10-30pp)
> "Moderate gap (18pp avg). Improving Crafts digital presence could increase ITO inclusion."

### Large Gap (≥ 30pp)
> "Large gap (39pp avg). Heritage has significant opportunity — ITOs want to feature this, but digital discoverability may be limiting inclusion."

---

## 8. Fixed Sector Key Mapping

### Problem:
- Data had "Audiovisual (film, TV, video, photography, animation)"
- Code was looking for "Audiovisual (film, photography, TV, videography)"
- Result: 0% values

### Solution:
Updated `sectorMapping` to match exact names from `dashboard_ito_data.json`:

```typescript
const sectorMapping: Record<string, string> = {
  'heritage': 'Cultural heritage sites/museums',
  'crafts': 'Crafts and artisan products',
  'performing_arts': 'Performing and visual arts (...)',
  'festivals': 'Festivals and cultural events',
  'audiovisual': 'Audiovisual (film, TV, video, photography, animation)', // FIXED
  'fashion': 'Fashion & Design (design, production, textiles)', // FIXED
  'publishing': 'Marketing/advertising/publishing'
};
```

---

## Real-World Example: Heritage Sector

### The Data:
- **Gambia Heritage:** 16% digital readiness
- **Gambia-Only Tours:** 44% ITO emphasis (+28pp gap)
- **Multi-Country Tours:** 55% ITO emphasis (+39pp gap)
- **Average Gap:** 33.5pp

### The Insight:
> "Heritage has significant opportunity — ITOs want to feature this (especially in regional packages), but digital discoverability may be limiting inclusion."

### The Badge:
**📈 Biggest Opportunity (Largest Gap)**

### Example Tours:
- **🇬🇲 Gambia-Only:** Responsible Travel - "Gambia and Senegal river cruise" (Creative Score: 66.2)
- **🌍 Multi-Country:** [filtered from regional tours]

### Packaging Strategy:
> "Operators emphasize this MORE in regional packages (+11pp). Position Gambian heritage within Senegambian or West African context."

### Action:
1. **Digital Priority:** Invest in heritage site websites, online presence, booking systems
2. **Partnership Focus:** Work with Senegal on joint heritage circuits (river cruises, slave trade history)
3. **Marketing Angle:** Position within Senegambian cultural heritage narrative
4. **Quick Win:** Improve discoverability to capture existing ITO demand

## Strategic Implications

### For DMO/Government:

1. **Investment Prioritization:**
   - Focus on "Furthest Gap" sector for maximum ROI on digital improvements
   - Quick wins in "Closest Gap" sector for immediate results

2. **Partnership Strategy:**
   - Sectors with high multi-country emphasis need regional collaborations
   - Sectors with high Gambia-only emphasis can be promoted standalone

3. **Digital Capacity Building:**
   - Target specific sectors where gaps reveal demand exists but supply isn't discoverable
   - Heritage shows clearest case: high ITO demand, low digital readiness

### For Creative Sector Stakeholders:

1. **Digital Investment Case:**
   - **Heritage (16% readiness, 55% regional emphasis):** Urgent need
   - **Publishing (54% readiness, 7% emphasis):** Less urgent
   
2. **Partnership Opportunities:**
   - Heritage, Crafts, Festivals all benefit from regional positioning
   - Focus on Senegambian partnerships

3. **Tour Operator Outreach:**
   - Study example tours to understand how to position offerings
   - Contact operators of high-emphasis tours with partnership proposals

### For Tour Operators (International):

1. **Discovery Problem Validation:**
   - Gap analysis confirms operators WANT to feature sectors but may not find them digitally
   - Solving discovery = more authentic content for tours

2. **Partnership Leads:**
   - Direct links to example tours from operators doing it right
   - Learn from leaders in each sector

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
1. Load `dashboard_ito_data.json` (gap_analysis items)
2. Load `ito_regional_analysis.json` (gambia_standalone.sector_averages)
3. Calculate enriched metrics per sector
4. Sort by absolute average gap to find closest/furthest
5. Render with dynamic insights

### Key Calculations:
```typescript
// Digital Readiness (out of 70 → %)
const digitalReadiness = Math.round((gambia_capacity / 70) * 100);

// Gambia-Only Emphasis (0-10 → %)
const gambiaOnlyScore = gambia_standalone.sector_averages[sectorKey];
const gambiaOnlyEmphasis = Math.round((gambiaOnlyScore / 10) * 100);

// Multi-Country Emphasis (weighted average)
const multiCountryScore = ((overallScore × totalTours) - (gambiaOnlyScore × gambiaOnlyTours)) / multiCountryTours;
const multiCountryEmphasis = Math.round((multiCountryScore / 10) * 100);

// Gaps
const gambiaOnlyGap = gambiaOnlyEmphasis - digitalReadiness;
const multiCountryGap = multiCountryEmphasis - digitalReadiness;
const avgGap = (gambiaOnlyGap + multiCountryGap) / 2;

// Find insights
const sortedByAbsGap = enrichedItems.sort((a, b) => Math.abs(a.avgGap) - Math.abs(b.avgGap));
const closestSector = sortedByAbsGap[0];
const furthestSector = sortedByAbsGap[length - 1];
```
