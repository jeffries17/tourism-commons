# Survey Integration in Recommendations - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The feedback received was:
> "I'm not sure if the survey results are reflected in the individual assessments or recommendations for the respondents. I believe they offer useful insights into both the individual companies and possible discrepancies between their responses and online profile performance (e.g., Abuko Pottery)."

**The Issue**: 
- Survey results were being collected and displayed in the dashboard
- BUT survey insights were NOT being used in the recommendation generation
- Recommendations were based solely on external assessment (what we observe online)
- Survey data about internal capacity (skills, knowledge, resources) was ignored

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Extended Data Reading (`get_participant_data`)
**Before**: Only read columns A-AL (up to column 38)
**After**: Now reads columns A-AT (up to column 46) to include survey breakdown scores

**New Data Captured:**
- Survey Foundation score (0-10): Current digital platforms and presence
- Survey Capability score (0-10): Skills, tools, infrastructure
- Survey Growth Readiness score (0-10): Knowledge and investment capacity
- Survey Tier: Classification (Absent/Basic, Emerging, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
- `has_survey_data` flag: Whether participant completed survey

**Column Mapping (differs by sheet type):**
- CI Assessment: columns 40-44 (AO-AS)
- TO Assessment: columns 38-42 (AM-AQ)

### 2. Enhanced Recommendation Generation (`generate_category_specific_recommendation`)

**Now Incorporates:**

#### A. Survey Breakdown Display
```
**Survey Assessment (Internal Capacity):**
- Digital Foundation: 8.3/10 (platforms, posting frequency)
- Digital Capability: 8.5/10 (skills, tools, infrastructure)
- Growth Readiness: 3.5/10 (knowledge, investment capacity)
- Survey Tier: Intermediate
```

#### B. Discrepancy Detection
Compares external performance (0-70) vs internal capacity (0-30) as percentages:

**High External, Low Internal (>20% gap):**
```
⚠️ DISCREPANCY: External performance (35/70) is stronger than 
internal capacity (6/30). They may lack skills/resources to 
sustain current presence.
```
→ Recommendations prioritize: training, simpler workflows, sustainability

**Low External, High Internal (>20% gap):**
```
💡 OPPORTUNITY: Internal capacity (24/30) exceeds external 
performance (20/70). They have untapped potential!
```
→ Recommendations encourage: showcasing skills, leveraging existing knowledge

#### C. Context-Aware Recommendations
The AI now adjusts recommendations based on survey insights:

**Low Capability/Growth Scores → Focus on:**
- Simpler, more achievable steps
- Training or skill-building needs
- Low-cost/free tools
- Addressing resource constraints

**Example**: If Growth Readiness is 3.5/10, recommendations might suggest:
- "Start with free tools like Canva before investing in premium software"
- "Consider joining local digital skills workshops at the Gambia Tourism Board"
- "Focus on one platform first rather than trying to manage multiple accounts"

### 3. Enhanced Preview and Progress Display

**Preview Mode (`--preview`) now shows:**
```
📊 ASSESSMENT BREAKDOWN:
  External Score: 24.5/70 (35%)
  Survey Score: 6.1/30 (20%)

  Survey Breakdown:
    • Digital Foundation: 8.3/10
    • Digital Capability: 8.5/10
    • Growth Readiness: 3.5/10
    • Survey Tier: Intermediate

  ⚠️  DISCREPANCY DETECTED: External performance stronger than internal capacity
      → May need training/support to sustain current digital presence
```

**Main Processing Loop now shows:**
```
Total Participants: 87
With Survey Data: 7 (8%)
Without Survey Data: 80 (recommendations based on external assessment only)

[1/87] Abuko Pottery Center (Crafts and artisan products)
  Combined: 30.6/100 | External: 24.5/70 | Survey: 6.1/30
  Survey: Foundation 8.3 | Capability 8.5 | Growth 3.5
  ✓ Generated 6 recommendations
  ✓ Updated Recommendations sheet
```

## 📋 How It Works Now

### For Participants WITH Survey Data:
1. **Reads both assessments**: External (what we see) + Survey (what they report)
2. **Detects discrepancies**: Compares external vs internal capacity
3. **Identifies weak areas**: Foundation, Capability, or Growth gaps
4. **Generates holistic recommendations**: Addresses BOTH online presence AND internal capacity
5. **Prioritizes appropriately**: 
   - Low skills → simpler recommendations, training focus
   - High skills, low presence → encouragement to showcase more

### For Participants WITHOUT Survey Data:
1. Falls back to external-only assessment (as before)
2. Shows note: "No survey data available - recommendation based on external assessment only"
3. Recommendations still personalized but lack internal capacity insights

---

## 🎯 Example: Abuko Pottery Center

**Survey Data:**
- Foundation: 8.2/10 (has platforms)
- Capability: 8.5/10 (has skills/tools)
- Growth Readiness: **3.5/10** ⚠️ (knowledge/investment gap)
- External: 50% vs Survey: 68% = **18% discrepancy** (untapped potential!)

**OLD Approach** (external-only):
> "Abuko Pottery Center should enhance their social media engagement by using 
> Buffer to schedule posts consistently and reach a wider audience. They can 
> also utilize Canva to create visually appealing content that showcases their 
> artisan products, driving more interaction on Facebook and Instagram."

**NEW Approach** (with survey insights):
> "Abuko Pottery Center should enhance their social media presence by utilizing 
> tools like Canva for visually appealing posts and Buffer for consistent scheduling, 
> ensuring a steady flow of engaging content. Additionally, they should **invest in 
> digital marketing training to build growth readiness** and better leverage their 
> existing platforms."

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ Identifies **root cause**: Low Growth Readiness (3.5/10)
- ✅ Recommends **training** not just more tools
- ✅ Recognizes discrepancy: High internal capacity (68%) vs lower external presence (50%)
- ✅ Addresses WHY they're not fully leveraging existing skills/tools
- ✅ Short, concise, third-person format

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `generate_participant_recommendations.py` (main changes)
- `test_abuko_recommendations.py` (testing/comparison script)

### Key Functions Updated
1. **`get_survey_breakdown_data()`** - NEW function to read from Survey_Scoring sheet
2. **`get_participant_data()`** - Now merges survey breakdown by name matching
3. **`generate_category_specific_recommendation()`** - Incorporates survey insights in AI prompt
4. **`preview_mode()`** - Displays survey breakdown and discrepancies
5. **Main loop** - Shows survey stats and progress

### Data Sources
**Survey breakdown scores are read from the `Survey_Scoring` sheet:**
```python
# Survey_Scoring sheet columns:
# A: Participant Name
# B: Type (CI/TO)
# C: Survey Date
# D: Total Score (/30)
# E: Foundation Score (/10)  ← index 4
# F: Capability Score (/10)  ← index 5
# G: Growth Score (/10)      ← index 6
