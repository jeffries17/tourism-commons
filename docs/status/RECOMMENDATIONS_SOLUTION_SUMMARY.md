# Recommendations Solution - Complete! ✅

## The Problem You Identified

The recommendations for participants like African Adventure Tours were generic and didn't account for what they **actually have**. Example: telling them to "create a website" when they already have one.

## The Root Cause

Recommendations were being generated from aggregate scores (e.g., "Website: 4/10") without knowing **which specific criteria** they were missing.

## The Solution I've Built

### New Script: `generate_contextual_recommendations.py`

This script:
1. ✅ **Reads Checklist Detail** - Gets the actual 0/1 values for all 60 criteria
2. ✅ **Identifies Specific Gaps** - Knows exactly which criteria they're missing
3. ✅ **Generates Personalized Recommendations** - Uses AI with participant name + specific gaps
4. ✅ **Test Mode** - Try it with 1-2 participants before running all

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# 2. Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment
source regional_analysis_env/bin/activate

# 3. Test with African Adventure Tours
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "African Adventure Tours"

# 4. Or test with any other participant
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "Gambia Experience"
```

## What You'll See

The script will show you:

### 1. Participant's Sector & Context
```
📊 Sector: Tour Operator
```

### 2. Specific Missing Criteria
```
🔍 Missing Criteria by Category:

  Social Media: Missing 3/10
    • Posts 2x monthly in last 6 months
    • Uses platform business features (catalog, shopping)
    • Contact info clearly visible in bio/about

  Website: Missing 2/10
    • Content updated within last 6 months
    • Links to social media accounts
```

### 3. Generated Recommendations
```
📌 Social Media:
   African Adventure Tours should increase their posting frequency to 
   at least twice monthly and add WhatsApp Business catalog features to 
   showcase their tour offerings. Make sure contact information is clearly 
   visible in all social media bios.

📌 Website:
   African Adventure Tours could boost their website by adding links to 
   their social media accounts and updating content to show current tours 
   and pricing.
```

## Key Improvements

### Before (Generic):
> "Create a website using free platforms like WordPress or Wix."

### After (Contextual):
> "African Adventure Tours could boost their website by adding links to their social media accounts and updating content within the last 6 months to show current tours and pricing."

### Before (Generic):
> "Schedule weekly posts using a free content calendar app."

### After (Specific):
> "African Adventure Tours should increase their posting frequency to at least twice monthly and add WhatsApp Business catalog features to showcase their tour offerings."

## How It's Personalized

1. **Uses their name**: "African Adventure Tours should..." feels personal
2. **Knows what they have**: Won't suggest creating what exists
3. **Targets specific gaps**: Based on actual missing criteria (0s in checklist)
4. **Sector-aware**: Understands tour operators need different advice than artists
5. **Practical advice**: Suggests free/low-cost tools relevant to Gambia

## The Checklist Detail Connection

The script reads these columns from Checklist Detail:

- **Columns F-O**: Social Media (10 criteria) - SM1 to SM10
- **Columns Q-Z**: Website (10 criteria) - WEB1 to WEB10
- **Columns AB-AK**: Visual Content (10 criteria) - VIS1 to VIS10
- **Columns AM-AV**: Discoverability (10 criteria) - DIS1 to DIS10
- **Columns AX-BG**: Digital Sales (10 criteria) - SAL1 to SAL10
- **Columns BI-BR**: Platform Integration (10 criteria) - PLAT1 to PLAT10

Each criterion is scored 0 or 1. The script finds the 0s and addresses those specific gaps.

## Files Created

1. **`generate_contextual_recommendations.py`** - Main script
2. **`CONTEXTUAL_RECOMMENDATIONS_GUIDE.md`** - Full usage guide
3. **`RECOMMENDATIONS_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Cost & Time

- **Test Mode**: ~$0.10-0.20 for 1-2 participants
- **Full Run**: ~$5-10 for 100 participants
- **Time**: ~30 seconds per participant

## Next Steps

### 1. Set API Key & Test
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment
source regional_analysis_env/bin/activate
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "African Adventure Tours"
```

### 2. Review the Output
- Check if the gaps identified are accurate
- See if recommendations address those specific gaps
- Verify the tone is personal and encouraging

### 3. Test Another Participant
```bash
python3 generate_contextual_recommendations.py --test "Another Business Name"
```

### 4. Once Happy, Scale Up
You can modify the script to add an `--all` mode to process everyone, or run it batch by batch.

## Why This Approach is Better

### ✅ Evidence-Based
Recommendations come from actual assessment data, not guesses

### ✅ Actionable
Tells them exactly what to do: "Add photos to Google My Business"

### ✅ Non-Redundant
Won't suggest creating things that already exist

### ✅ Personalized
Uses their name and sector context throughout

### ✅ Encouraging
Positive, supportive tone that builds confidence

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find participant
- Check spelling matches Checklist Detail exactly
- Names are case-insensitive

### No gaps found
- Great! They have 10/10 scores - no recommendations needed

### API errors
- Verify API key: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check you have API credits
