# ITO Perception Analysis - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Goal
Understand how International Tour Operators (ITOs) position and perceive Gambian creative tourism offerings through AI-powered content analysis.

## üìä Data Sources
- **29 Tour Operators** 
- **28 Gambia destination pages** (general marketing)
- **14 tour/itinerary pages** (specific packages)

## üîß Technical Stack

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
**Tool:** Playwright + BeautifulSoup
- Scrape Gambia pages and tour pages
- Extract main content (filter navigation/footers)
- Save raw text + HTML structure
- Extract metadata (title, description)

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Analysis
**Primary Engine:** Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Sentiment analysis
- Entity recognition (places, activities)
- Content classification

**Secondary Engine:** OpenAI GPT-4 (for deep insights)
- Thematic analysis
- Quote extraction
- Cultural positioning assessment

### Phase 3: Creative Industry Detection
**Custom NLP Pipeline:**
- Keyword matching for 8 sectors
- Context analysis (mentioned vs. featured)
- Depth scoring (word count, placement, emphasis)

## üìà Metrics to Calculate

### 1. Creative Industry Visibility
**Per Sector (0-10 scale):**
- Music
- Crafts & Artisan Products
- Heritage Sites & Museums
- Fashion & Design
- Festivals & Cultural Events
- Audiovisual (Film/Photo)
- Performing & Visual Arts
- Publishing/Marketing

**Scoring Logic:**
- 0 = Not mentioned
- 1-3 = Brief mention (1 sentence)
- 4-6 = Described (paragraph, some detail)
- 7-9 = Featured (dedicated section, itinerary item)
- 10 = Highlighted (key selling point, extensive coverage)

### 2. Overall Creative Tourism Score (0-100)
- Sum of all 8 sector scores √ó 1.25
- Measures: How much is Gambia positioned as a cultural/creative destination?

### 3. Sentiment Analysis (-1 to +1)
- Overall tone toward Gambia
- Language quality (enthusiastic vs. generic)
- Positioning (unique vs. commodity)

### 4. Packaging Analysis
**From Existing Columns + AI Analysis:**
- Solo destination vs. multi-country
- % of itinerary in Gambia (AI calculates from day-by-day)
- Gambia's role: Primary vs. add-on vs. transit

### 5. Positioning Categories
**AI-Detected Primary Themes (rank 1-3):**
- Beach/Resort destination
- Wildlife/Nature destination
- Cultural heritage destination
- Adventure/Active destination
- Roots/Diaspora tourism
- Birding/Specialist destination

### 6. Quote Extraction
**AI selects most representative quotes:**
- Best positive quote about Gambia
- Most compelling cultural mention
- Any unique positioning statements
