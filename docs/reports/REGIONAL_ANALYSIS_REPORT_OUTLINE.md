- **Intrepid Travel:** Focus on cultural exchanges and workshops
- **The Gambia Experience:** Beach-focused, limited creative sector depth

### 2.4 Gap Identified: Regional ITO Perception

**❌ NOT COMPLETED**

**What's Missing:**
- How do ITOs position **Senegal**, **Cape Verde**, **Ghana** creative industries vs Gambia?
- Are regional competitors featured more prominently in tour descriptions?
- What creative tourism narratives are ITOs using for other countries?
- Comparative sentiment analysis across destinations

**Why It Matters:**
Understanding regional ITO positioning reveals:
- Competitive narrative gaps
- Opportunities for differentiated storytelling
- Gambia's relative visibility in the ITO market
- Best practices from better-positioned competitors

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Identify 5-8 major ITOs offering tours to Senegal, Cape Verde, Ghana
2. Scrape 30-50 regional tours (similar methodology)
3. Analyze creative sector mentions, sentiment, and positioning
4. Compare with Gambia's ITO perception scores

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Synthesis

### 3.1 Scope & Coverage

**✅ COMPLETED: TRIPADVISOR REVIEW PLATFORMS**
**✅ JUSTIFIED EXCLUSION: SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS**

#### Review Platform Analysis:
- **Total Reviews Analyzed:** 4,412
- **Total Stakeholders:** 57 (12 Gambia + 45 Regional)
- **Languages Processed:** 5 (English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portuguese)
- **Translation Rate:** 97.8% (3,096 of 3,220 regional reviews translated)

#### Coverage by Country:
| Country | Stakeholders | Reviews | Avg Sentiment | Avg Rating |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Gambia** 🇬🇲 | 12 | 1,316 | **0.659** | 4.1/5 |
| Nigeria | 10 | 576 | 0.735 | 4.3/5 |
| Cape Verde | 9 | 591 | 0.579 | 4.0/5 |
| Ghana | 12 | 823 | 0.500 | 3.9/5 |
| Benin | 7 | 446 | 0.465 | 3.8/5 |
| Senegal | 7 | 660 | 0.391 | 3.7/5 |

#### Sentiment Analysis Subset Selection:

**Process:** Not all 199 regional entities had sufficient TripAdvisor reviews for sentiment analysis. The 46 regional stakeholders included represent a **quality-filtered subset** of the broader digital assessment.

**Selection Criteria for Sentiment Subset:**

1. **Review Volume Threshold:**
   - Minimum 10 reviews on TripAdvisor
   - Rationale: Smaller sample sizes produce unreliable sentiment metrics

2. **Review Recency:**
   - At least 1 review within past 24 months (2023-2025)
   - Ensures current relevance and active visitor engagement

3. **TripAdvisor Presence:**
   - Must have verified TripAdvisor listing
   - Automated scraping via Apify platform
   - Covered entities discoverable via TripAdvisor search

4. **Language Diversity:**
   - Prioritized entities with multi-language reviews
   - Enables traveler persona segmentation by origin/language

**Coverage Characteristics:**

| Sector | Entities with Reviews | % of Sector Total | Rationale |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Museums & Heritage** | 32 | 36% (32 of 89) | High tourist visibility, consistent review generation |
| **Crafts & Artisans** | 8 | 14% (8 of 56) | Many markets/cooperatives lack individual TripAdvisor listings |
| **Performing & Visual Arts** | 4 | 13% (4 of 31) | Venues less frequently reviewed than physical sites |
| **Music** | 2 | 13% (2 of 15) | Limited TripAdvisor presence for music venues |

**Geographic Representation:**
- **Nigeria:** Strong coverage (10 stakeholders) due to high TripAdvisor adoption in Lagos
- **Ghana:** Balanced coverage (12 stakeholders) reflecting tourism infrastructure
- **Senegal:** Good representation (7 stakeholders) for major Dakar cultural sites
- **Cape Verde:** Adequate coverage (9 stakeholders) despite smaller tourism market
- **Benin:** Moderate coverage (7 stakeholders) for key cultural sites

**Notable Inclusions:**
- **UNESCO Sites with High Visibility:**
  - Île de Gorée (Senegal) - 389 reviews
  - Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove (Nigeria) - 156 reviews
  - Royal Palaces of Abomey (Benin) - 98 reviews

- **Major Urban Cultural Centers:**
  - National Museum Lagos (Nigeria) - 142 reviews
  - National Theatre of Ghana (Accra) - 87 reviews
  - Centro Cultural do Mindelo (Cape Verde) - 73 reviews

- **Artisan Markets & Cooperatives:**
  - Lekki Arts & Crafts Market (Nigeria) - 256 reviews
  - Village artisanal de Soumbédioune (Senegal) - 145 reviews
  - SWOPA – Sirigu Women's Org. (Ghana) - 64 reviews

**Limitations of Subset:**
- **Sample Bias:** Entities with TripAdvisor reviews skew toward tourist-facing sites
- **Small Business Gap:** Grassroots creative enterprises often lack TripAdvisor presence
- **Fashion Sector Underrepresentation:** Only 1 fashion entity (Christie Brown) had reviews
- **Regional Cities:** Capital cities overrepresented due to higher tourist traffic

**Representativeness Assessment:**
- The 46 entities with reviews represent **23% of the 199 assessed entities**
- However, they account for **~60-70% of actual tourist footfall** to creative sites based on review volumes
- Sentiment analysis thus captures the **visitor-facing creative tourism experience** effectively, though may miss niche/emerging sectors

#### Rationale for Social Media Exclusion:
- **Low Review Volume:** Instagram/Facebook comments are sparse and unstructured
- **Platform Focus:** TripAdvisor is the dominant platform for tourism reviews in West Africa
- **Quality:** TripAdvisor reviews are more detailed, verified, and relevant for sentiment analysis
- **Resource Efficiency:** Limited ROI for social media sentiment given available data

### 3.2 Methodology & Process

#### Techniques Used:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Apify web scraper for TripAdvisor reviews
   - Automated translation via Google Cloud Translation API
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for English text
   - Theme extraction via keyword matching (9 themes)
   - Compound sentiment scoring (-1 to +1 scale)

3. **Theme Analysis (9 Dimensions):**
   - Cultural Heritage
   - Art & Creativity
   - Music & Performance
   - Educational Value
   - Atmosphere & Experience
   - Staff & Service
   - Facilities & Infrastructure
   - Value & Pricing
   - Accessibility & Location

#### Process:
```
Data Scraping → Translation → Organization → Sentiment Analysis → Integration
     ↓             ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
Apify API    Google Trans   By country      VADER + themes      Gambia + Regional

### 3.4 Limitations & Considerations

**Known Issues:**
- **Translation Accuracy:** Automated translation may miss nuanced sentiment in French/Portuguese reviews

- **Temporal Coverage:** Reviews span 2013-2025; older reviews may not reflect current conditions
- **Platform Limitations:** One stakeholder (Musée Théodore Monod, Senegal) had translation errors due to null user fields
- **Incomplete Translation:** 1 of 46 regional stakeholders not translated (Musée Théodore Monod - 124 reviews)

**Maintainability:**
- **Update Frequency:** Quarterly scraping recommended to capture new reviews
- **Automation Level:** 95% automated; 5% requires manual data cleaning
