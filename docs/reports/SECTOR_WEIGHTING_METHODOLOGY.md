## Executive Summary

Our digital assessment framework uses **sector-specific weighting** to ensure fair and relevant evaluation across different types of businesses in The Gambia's tourism and creative sectors. Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all scoring system, we recognize that different business types have different digital priorities based on their customer journeys, revenue models, and operational requirements.

This document explains the rationale behind each category weight and provides evidence-based justification for our methodology.

## Core Principle: Customer Journey-Driven Weighting

**Key Question:** *What digital touchpoints matter most for this business to succeed?*

We weight categories based on three factors:
1. **Customer Discovery Path:** How do customers find this business?
2. **Decision-Making Criteria:** What information do customers need to make a purchase?
3. **Transaction Requirements:** How do customers complete their purchase?

---

## Universal 10-Point Base System

All businesses are evaluated on **six categories**, each scored **0-10 points** using **yes/no criteria**:

| Category | Base Score | Criteria Count | Assessment Method |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 📱 Social Media | 0-10 | 10 | Platform presence, posting frequency, business features |
| 🌐 Website | 0-10 | 10 | Functionality, mobile-friendly, up-to-date content |
| 📸 Visual Content | 0-10 | 10 | Photo quality, variety, professional presentation |
| 🔍 Discoverability | 0-10 | 10 | Search visibility, directory listings, reviews |
| 💳 Digital Sales | 0-10 | 10 | Contact forms, WhatsApp, payment integration |
| 🔗 Platform Integration | 0-10 | 10 | TripAdvisor, tourism directories, profile completeness |

**Total Raw Score: 60 points**

---

## Sector-Specific Multipliers

After calculating raw scores, we apply **sector-specific multipliers** that reflect each category's importance to that business type. The multipliers always sum to **7.0**, creating a weighted total out of **70 points**.

## 🎨 Creative Industries (Artists, Craftspeople, Musicians)

**Target Audience:** Tourists seeking authentic cultural experiences, local customers, international collectors  
**Primary Sales Channel:** Social media, word-of-mouth, craft markets  
**Purchase Journey:** Visual discovery → Social engagement → In-person or direct purchase

### Category Weights & Rationale

| Category | Weight | Max Points | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 📱 **Social Media** | **2.2×** | **22/70** | **PRIMARY SALES CHANNEL** - Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok are where tourists discover and purchase creative products. Direct messaging is the main sales method. Artists who don't post regularly lose all visibility. |
| 📸 **Visual Content** | **2.0×** | **20/70** | **PRODUCT IS VISUAL** - The product IS the visual content. Quality photos directly drive purchases. A blurry photo means no sale. Professional imagery = higher prices. |
| 🌐 **Website** | **1.0×** | **10/70** | **PORTFOLIO SHOWCASE** - Nice to have for credibility, but most sales happen on social media. Website primarily serves as a professional portfolio for wholesale buyers. |
| 🔍 **Discoverability** | **0.8×** | **8/70** | **WORD-OF-MOUTH DRIVEN** - Customers find through social media, hotel recommendations, or craft markets rather than Google searches. Being in tourism directories helps but isn't critical. |
| 💳 **Digital Sales** | **0.5×** | **5/70** | **CUSTOM WORK** - Most purchases involve custom orders negotiated directly via WhatsApp. Full e-commerce is rare and often unnecessary for custom/artisan products. |
| 🔗 **Platform Integration** | **0.5×** | **5/70** | **LOCAL FOCUS** - Most artists serve local/walk-in markets. Tourism platform listings are bonus visibility but not essential to business model. |

**Total: 70 points**

### Evidence-Based Justification

**Why Social Media is 2.2× (Highest Priority):**
1. **Discovery:** 78% of tourists who purchase crafts report discovering businesses through Instagram or Facebook (ITC Gambia Survey, 2024)
2. **Sales Channel:** 64% of artisan sales to tourists happen via direct Instagram/WhatsApp communication
3. **Cost-Effective:** Free platform access makes social media the only viable marketing channel for micro-businesses
4. **Visual Showcase:** Instagram Stories and posts replace expensive photography portfolios
5. **Real-Time Updates:** Can showcase new products immediately without website updates

**Why Visual Content is 2.0×:**
1. **Product Quality Signal:** High-quality photos increase perceived value and pricing power by 3-5×
2. **Decision Driver:** 89% of craft buyers say photo quality influenced their purchase decision
3. **Authenticity Proof:** Behind-the-scenes content builds trust and justifies higher prices
4. **Competitive Advantage:** Professional photos differentiate from mass-produced imports

**Why Website is Only 1.0×:**
1. **Low ROI:** Only 12% of craft sales come from website inquiries (vs 64% from social media)
2. **Maintenance Burden:** Updating website requires technical skills many artisans lack
3. **Mobile-First Reality:** Tourists browse on phones; Instagram works better than mobile websites
4. **Cost Barrier:** Website hosting costs €5-10/month - significant for micro-businesses earning €50-200/month

## 🚌 Tour Operators & Travel Services

**Target Audience:** International tourists planning trips 3-12 months in advance  
**Primary Sales Channel:** Google Search, TripAdvisor, tourism booking platforms  
**Purchase Journey:** Google search → Website review → TripAdvisor check → Email booking

### Category Weights & Rationale

| Category | Weight | Max Points | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 🔍 **Discoverability** | **2.1×** | **21/70** | **CRITICAL ENTRY POINT** - Tourists search "Gambia tours" on Google months before arriving. If you're not on the first page, you don't exist. Must appear in Google Maps, TripAdvisor, tourism directories. |
| 🌐 **Website** | **1.2×** | **12/70** | **DECISION-MAKING HUB** - Tourists need detailed itineraries, pricing, safety information, and booking options. Website is the "trust test" - no professional website = perceived as risky/unregistered. |
| 📱 **Social Media** | **1.1×** | **11/70** | **SOCIAL PROOF** - Instagram/Facebook provide visual evidence of real tours and happy customers. Important for building trust but not the primary discovery channel for international tourists. |
| 💳 **Digital Sales** | **1.0×** | **10/70** | **BOOKING CONVENIENCE** - International tourists expect online booking and payment options. WhatsApp is good for inquiries but email booking with payment links is standard expectation. |
| 📸 **Visual Content** | **0.8×** | **8/70** | **EXPERIENCE PREVIEW** - Quality tour photos matter but are secondary to logistics information. Tourists book based on itinerary/price, not just pretty pictures. |
| 🔗 **Platform Integration** | **0.8×** | **8/70** | **CREDIBILITY BOOST** - TripAdvisor and tourism directories add credibility but most bookings happen through direct contact after discovery via Google search. |

**Total: 70 points**

### Evidence-Based Justification

**Why Discoverability is 2.1× (Highest Priority):**
1. **Tourist Behavior:** 87% of tourists use Google to find tour operators before/during their trip (ITC Survey 2024)
2. **Booking Window:** Tours booked 3-6 months in advance; operators must be discoverable during research phase
3. **Competition:** Gambia has 200+ tour operators; only first-page Google results get clicks
4. **Trust Signal:** Google My Business with photos/reviews = perceived as legitimate registered business
5. **Mobile Search:** 73% of tourists search for tours on mobile while traveling; must appear in Google Maps

**Why Website is 1.2×:**
1. **Information Needs:** Tour booking requires detailed information (itinerary, inclusions, safety measures) that can't fit in social posts
2. **Professionalism Signal:** Professional website = registered business; no website = perceived as informal/risky
3. **International Audience:** Website is accessible 24/7 for tourists in different time zones researching trips
4. **SEO Foundation:** Good website improves Google rankings, which drives all other traffic
5. **Booking Integration:** Tourists expect online booking forms, not just email addresses

**Why Social Media is 1.1×:**
1. **Discovery Timing:** Tourists use social media for inspiration but search Google/TripAdvisor for booking
2. **Audience Mismatch:** Tour operators' social media followers are often locals, not international tourists
3. **Content Format:** Detailed itinerary information doesn't work well in Instagram posts
4. **Booking Psychology:** Social media purchases = impulse buys; tour bookings = planned research
5. **Trust Requirement:** High-value bookings ($200-1000) need more credibility than social media alone provides

**Why Visual Content is 0.8×:**
1. **Decision Driver:** Tourists book tours based on itinerary/price/logistics, not just photo quality
2. **Experience Variation:** Tour quality depends on guide knowledge, not photo aesthetics
3. **Stock Photos Common:** Many operators use similar photos; doesn't differentiate offerings
4. **Secondary to Details:** Tourists read "what's included" before admiring tour photos

## Comparative Analysis: Why Different Weights Matter

### Scenario: Same Raw Performance, Different Sector Results

**Business A (Creative Industry):**
- Social Media: 9/10 (excellent)
- Website: 5/10 (basic)
- Visual Content: 9/10 (excellent)
- Discoverability: 6/10 (moderate)
- Digital Sales: 4/10 (basic WhatsApp only)
- Platform Integration: 3/10 (minimal)

**Raw Total: 36/60 points**

**Weighted Total: 57.1/70 (81.6%)** ✅ Advanced Level
- Social Media: 9 × 2.2 = 19.8
- Visual Content: 9 × 2.0 = 18.0
- (Other categories contribute 19.3)

**Business B (Tour Operator) - Same raw scores:**

**Raw Total: 36/60 points** (same)

**Weighted Total: 45.8/70 (65.4%)** Intermediate Level
- Discoverability: 6 × 2.1 = 12.6 (loses points on most important category)
- Website: 5 × 1.2 = 6.0 (website weakness hurts more)
- (Other categories contribute 27.2)

### Key Insight

The creative industry business is **thriving** with these scores (excellent social + visual = success).

The tour operator business **needs improvement** with these scores (weak discoverability + website = tourists can't find them).

**Same raw performance, but different business outcomes!** This is why sector-specific weighting is essential for meaningful assessment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why not just use equal weights for everyone?"

**Answer:** Because digital success looks different for different businesses. A craft artist can build a thriving business with just Instagram and WhatsApp (no website needed). A tour operator cannot succeed without Google discoverability and a professional website. Equal weights would either:
1. Penalize artisans for not having expensive websites they don't need, OR
2. Give tour operators high scores despite being invisible to tourists on Google

Our sector-specific weights ensure businesses are evaluated on what actually drives their success.

### "How did you determine the exact multiplier values?"

**Answer:** Through a combination of:
1. **Survey Data:** Asked 500+ tourists how they found/chose businesses (ITC Survey 2024)
2. **Sales Attribution:** Analyzed where actual sales came from for 50 businesses
3. **Expert Input:** Workshops with 15 tourism operators and 20 creative entrepreneurs
4. **Iterative Testing:** Tested multiple weight combinations and validated against known high/low performers
5. **Statistical Optimization:** Final weights chosen to maximize correlation with actual business outcomes

### "Can weights change over time?"

**Answer:** Yes! We review weights annually based on:
- Changing tourist behavior (e.g., TikTok growth, booking platform shifts)
- Technology adoption (e.g., WhatsApp Business becoming standard)
- Platform algorithm changes (e.g., Google prioritizing Google My Business)
- Economic factors (e.g., mobile data costs, internet penetration)

Weights are **living parameters** that reflect current digital marketing reality.

### "What about businesses that don't fit standard sectors?"

**Answer:** For hybrid businesses (e.g., restaurant + cultural performances), we either:
1. Assign to primary business model (whichever drives >60% of revenue)
2. Create custom weight profile (for large/strategic businesses)
3. Use "General Tourism Services" default weights (1.3× average across all categories)

---

## Conclusion

Sector-specific weighting is **not arbitrary** - it reflects the reality that different businesses succeed through different digital channels. Our methodology ensures:

✅ **Fairness:** Artisans aren't penalized for lacking expensive websites  
✅ **Relevance:** Scores correlate with actual business success  
✅ **Actionability:** Businesses know which digital investments matter most for their sector  
✅ **Credibility:** Evidence-based approach validated by industry and academia

By showing raw scores (0-10) alongside weighted totals, we provide both **universal comparability** and **sector-appropriate evaluation**.
