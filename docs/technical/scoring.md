Assessment Implementation Notes
For Field Assessors:
Use Observable Evidence: Look for specific, visible elements rather than making assumptions
Check Multiple Touchpoints: Verify consistency across platforms
Test Functionality: Actually click links, test contact forms, check mobile responsiveness
Document Examples: Note specific evidence that supports the score assigned
Consider Context: Rural businesses may have different infrastructure constraints
Time-Bound Assessment: Note when assessment was conducted as digital presence changes rapidly
Common Assessment Mistakes to Avoid:
Don't assume technical complexity equals quality
Don't penalize for platform choices (some businesses succeed with WhatsApp-only strategies)
Don't require expensive equipment evidence for higher scores
Don't conflate personal social media activity with business strategy
Don't apply uniform standards across different creative industry sectors
Validation Questions for Borderline Scores:
Can customers easily find and contact this business online?
Is the digital presence helping or hindering business growth?
Are customers responding positively to their online content?
Does their online presence accurately represent their business capabilities?
Can they effectively reach their target audience through current digital channels?
