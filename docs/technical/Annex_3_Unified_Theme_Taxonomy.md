## 3. Theme Detection Algorithm

### 3.1 Keyword Matching Process

**Step 1: Text Preprocessing**
```
Original Review → Lowercase Conversion → Punctuation Normalization → Keyword Scanning
```

**Step 2: Keyword Detection**
```python
def detect_theme_keywords(text, theme_keywords):
    matches = 0
    for keyword in theme_keywords:
        if keyword in text.lower():
            matches += 1
    return matches
```

**Step 3: Theme Presence Determination**
- **Threshold:** ≥1 keyword match = theme present
- **Frequency:** Count of total keyword matches per theme
- **Percentage:** (Reviews with theme present / Total reviews) × 100

### 3.2 Context Filtering System

**False Positive Prevention:**
- **Proximity Analysis:** Keywords must appear in relevant context
- **Context Windows:** 50-character windows around keyword matches
- **Filtering Rules:** Exclude promotional content, booking CTAs, unrelated contexts

**Example Context Filtering:**
```
❌ "Book now for the best experience" (excluded - promotional)
✅ "The book collection was impressive" (included - relevant context)
❌ "Video player not working" (excluded - technical issue)
✅ "Video documentation was excellent" (included - relevant context)
```

### 3.3 Quality Assurance Measures

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Cross-Stakeholder Consistency:** Same themes detected across similar sites
2. **Manual Spot-Checking:** Random sample validation of theme detection
3. **Regional Benchmarking:** Theme performance compared to regional averages
4. **Statistical Significance:** Minimum sample size requirements (n ≥ 100)

**Error Handling:**
- **Missing Keywords:** Logged and reviewed for taxonomy updates
- **Ambiguous Matches:** Manual review and context analysis
- **Low Frequency Themes:** Investigated for detection issues

---

## 4. Theme Frequency Calculation

### 4.1 Percentage Calculation Method

**Formula:**
```
Theme Frequency % = (Reviews with Theme Present / Total Reviews) × 100
```

**Example - Market Shopping Enthusiasts:**
- **Total Reviews:** 176 reviews
- **Reviews with "Market Experience" theme:** 157 reviews
- **Calculation:** (157 / 176) × 100 = 89.2%
- **Rounded:** 89%

### 4.2 Theme Presence Criteria

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Single Keyword Match:** Theme marked as present
- **Context Validation:** Keyword must appear in relevant context
- **Proximity Threshold:** Keywords within 50 characters of relevant content

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Sample Size:** n ≥ 100 reviews per persona
- **Theme Consistency:** ≥15% theme mention rate for statistical significance
- **Cross-Validation:** Theme detection consistent across multiple stakeholders

## 5. Cross-Regional Theme Mapping

### 5.1 Unified Taxonomy Benefits

**Before Unification:**
- Gambian data: 8 themes (including "ferry_service")

- **Result:** Cannot do meaningful cross-comparison

**After Unification:**

- **Result:** Direct cross-comparison capability

### 5.2 Theme Mapping Examples

**Gambian Theme Mapping:**
```javascript
const gambianMapping = {
  'cultural_value': 'cultural_heritage',
  'historical_significance': 'cultural_heritage',
  'guide_quality': 'service_staff',
  'infrastructure_state': 'facilities_infrastructure',
  'accessibility_comfort': 'accessibility_transport',
  'ferry_service': 'accessibility_transport',
  'value_pricing': 'value_money',
  'safety_security': 'safety_security'
};
```

**Regional Theme Mapping:**
```javascript
const regionalMapping = {
  'cultural_heritage': 'cultural_heritage',
  'staff_service': 'service_staff',
  'facilities_infrastructure': 'facilities_infrastructure',
  'accessibility_location': 'accessibility_transport',
  'value_pricing': 'value_money',
  'educational_value': 'educational_value',
  'art_creativity': 'artistic_creative',
