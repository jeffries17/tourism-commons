## COMPARISON TO EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT

The 30-point survey score is **separate** from the 70-point external assessment:
- **External Assessment (70 points)**: What we observe from outside (website quality, social presence, reviews, etc.)
- **Survey Assessment (30 points)**: Internal capacity (skills, knowledge, resources, readiness)

**Combined View**: Total 100 points
- 70 points: External digital presence/performance
- 30 points: Internal digital capacity/readiness

This dual scoring reveals:
- **High External + High Survey**: Digital leaders maintaining strong presence
- **High External + Low Survey**: May be outsourcing or have single skilled person (sustainability risk)
- **Low External + High Survey**: Untapped potential (skilled but not executing)
- **Low External + Low Survey**: Need comprehensive support
