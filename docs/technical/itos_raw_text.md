Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, the castle highlights the stark contrasts of the era, with Europeans living in luxury above the crowded, squalid slave dungeons. The infamous "Door of No Return" led countless enslaved Africans to ships bound for the brutal Middle Passage.

The twin cities of Sekondi-Takoradi, known as Tadi, are a key commercial hub on Ghana’s deepwater port, featuring a 17th-century Dutch fort, a relaxed beachfront and Africa’s largest market offering coconuts, dried fish, and tangy jollof rice.

Day 13-14: Takoradi | Elmina
Accommodation2 Breakfasts, 2 Lunches, 2 Dinners
The twin cities of Sekondi-Takoradi, known as Tadi, are a key commercial hub on Ghana’s deepwater port, featuring a 17th-century Dutch fort, a relaxed beachfront and Africa’s largest market offering coconuts, dried fish, and tangy jollof rice. Nearby Kakum National Park hosts an endangered Ghanaian rainforest with native wildlife, lush plant life, exotic birds, vibrant butterflies, and a Canopy Walkway, suspended 100 feet above the ground.

A solemn reminder of the past, the 15th century Elmina Castle in Ghana was a key slave trade hub, originally protecting the gold trade before Dutch and British slave trade involvement. This UNESCO site exemplified the era's contradictions, with Europeans in luxurious quarters above filthy, cramped slave dungeons. The infamous Door of No Return opened to ships on the grueling Middle Passage.
Day 15: Tema (Accra) | Disembark
1 Breakfast
Tema is a short drive from Ghana’s fast-paced capital, Accra, a city that's culturally rich, modern, and historic all at once. European-built forts and Black Star Independence Square’s public monuments offer a glimpse at the past. The neighborhood of Jamestown, a 17th-century fishing community with old colonial buildings, is its pulse with an art scene and local bites like waakye­ – rice and beans with sides – at a low-key ‘chop bar’.

After breakfast, bid farewell to your fellow travelers as you disembark today. Then, head to the airport for your flight home.

More about the destination
The friendly locals warmly welcome you to Gambia, also known as "the smiling coast". Scandinavian holidaymakers have been coming here since the 1960s to experience everything from sun-drenched beaches and exciting excursions to local markets and genuine everyday life.
Gambia is located in West Africa, east of Cape Verde and shares a border with Senegal, which surrounds the country except along the coastline.
Long sandy beaches
Look forward to relaxing beach days and lazy days in a sun lounger on one of Gambia's lovely, kilometer-long beaches. The fine-grained sandy beaches are both numerous and large - perfect for those who want to spread out and avoid crowds. In the afternoon, when the temperature has dropped slightly, people gather on the beach to play football, walk or just enjoy the beautiful sunset.
On Sundays, locals head to the beach for a day of socializing and relaxation. Picnic baskets are packed and the beach becomes a gathering place where people socialize, swim, play soccer, and eat together.
Attractions & nature experiences
The Gambia is much more than just long sandy beaches! Explore the country's amazing wildlife that extends far beyond the coastline. How about taking a boat trip on the Gambia River and spotting hippos in their natural habitat or why not discover the rich birdlife in the impressive mangrove swamps?
If you want to discover the authentic Gambia, we recommend a visit to the exciting countryside, where you can explore local markets and everyday life.
Restaurants and entertainment
Enjoy delicious food at any of the many local and international restaurants. Try some of the local dishes Benachin, a rice and seafood dish, or the popular chili and peanut stew, Domada.
Gambia also offers a wide range of really good Lebanese restaurants, so take the opportunity to explore the delicious Lebanese cuisine during your vacation.
When it comes to nightclubs and bars, there is everything from simple beach bars, nice lounge bars to lively nightclubs that are open until late into the early hours.
Apollo's hotels & destinations in Gambia
In many of our destinations around the world you can stay along the beach, but in Gambia you literally live on the beach!
If you travel to Gambia with Apollo, you have the opportunity to choose from several fine hotels and areas along the beautiful Atlantic coast. If you want to stay "where it's happening", we recommend our hotels in Kololi and especially the Senegambia area, which offers a lively atmosphere with a pronounced entertainment scene, a wide range of restaurants offering everything from Lebanese to Italian food, and many nice bars.
In the Kotu area, one of Gambia's finest beaches awaits, and although several hotels are located on the beach, there is plenty of room for everyone. For those who want to stay in the best beach location, the sports hotel
Kombo Beach Resort
is an excellent choice, both fitness enthusiasts and families with children thrive here, who can both enjoy the hotel's many amenities and activities. In Kotu, there are also a couple of restaurants, small shops and cozy bars to explore.
In the Cape Point area you live close to both the beach and local life, which gives you the opportunity to discover and shop for fresh fruit and crafts at the local markets. For an extra quiet and relaxed holiday, we recommend the Bijilo area, beyond Gambia's slightly larger tourist areas. Here you can take the day as it comes and look forward to nice days in the sun lounger.
