# Safety & Security Theme - Analysis Fix

## Issue Identified

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Reported by:** User observation

### Problem
The sentiment analysis had extracted the **safety_security** theme for Gambian stakeholders but **NOT** for regional competitors, creating an incomplete comparison.

### Root Cause
The `regional_sentiment_analyzer.py` script used its own theme keywords (9 themes) that did NOT include `safety_security`:
- ✅ cultural_heritage
- ✅ art_creativity  
- ✅ music_performance
- ✅ educational_value
- ✅ atmosphere_experience
- ✅ staff_service
- ✅ facilities_infrastructure
- ✅ value_pricing
- ✅ accessibility_location
- ❌ **safety_security** ← MISSING

Meanwhile, the Gambian data was analyzed with the unified theme taxonomy in `enhanced_theme_analysis.py` which includes all 9 unified themes including `safety_security`.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Script Created
Created `reanalyze_regional_with_safety.py` which:
1. Uses the **EnhancedThemeAnalyzer** class with complete unified theme taxonomy
2. Re-analyzes all 45 regional competitor stakeholders
3. Extracts safety_security theme data alongside the other 8 themes
4. Updates the dashboard data file with complete theme coverage

### Execution
```bash
cd /Users/alexjeffries/tourism-commons/digital_assessment/sentiment/scripts
python3 reanalyze_regional_with_safety.py
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Dashboard/Reporting:**
   - Highlight that Gambia stakeholders have notably higher safety mentions
   - Frame this as a competitive advantage (visitors feel safe & operators emphasize it)
   - Include safety_security in all comparative theme analyses

2. **For Future Analysis:**
   - Always use the `EnhancedThemeAnalyzer` class for consistency
   - Monitor safety sentiment trends over time
   - Consider breaking down safety mentions into sub-categories (security, health, physical safety, etc.)

3. **For Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - Share positive safety scores with Gambian tour operators as a selling point
   - Investigate why some stakeholders have few/no safety mentions
   - Consider if low mentions indicate oversight or simply non-relevance

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Regional competitors now have complete safety_security theme extraction matching Gambian stakeholders.

**Confirmed by:** Comparative analysis showing both datasets with safety_security theme scores
