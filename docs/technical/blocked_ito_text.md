Day 1
Depart U.S.
Depart the U.S. today on an overnight flight bound for Dakar, Senegal.

Day 2
Arrive in Dakar, Senegal
Destination: Dakar
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: As the capital with 3 million inhabitants, anticipate chaotic traffic and a vibrant city stimulating all the senses.

This itinerary offers an off the beaten path experience. Expect coaches and hotels with lower standards than what we are used to in the U.S. and Europe. If you choose to join, a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace cultural differences is essential.

Morning/Afternoon: Depending on your individual flight arrangements, you'll arrive in Dakar, Senegal some time today. An O.A.T. representative will meet you at the airport and assist with your transfer to the hotel, where you'll meet your fellow travelers—including those who took our The Gulf of Guinea: Ghana, Togo & Benin pre-trip extension.

There, check in and enjoy some free time to relax and settle in. You may choose to join your Trip Experience Leader later for an optional orientation walk around the hotel's vicinity.

Dinner: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Head out to begin exploring Dakar on your own, or retire early after your day of traveling.

Day 3
Explore Dakar
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

African Renaissance Monument, Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: Expect encounters with beggars, particularly children, on the streets throughout your trip. It's not advisable to give anything individually, as it may create challenges when unable to provide for all. Consider alternative ways to support local communities, such as donating supplies to local organizations who offer aid to these communities, or ask your Trip Experience Leader where you can volunteer during free time.

Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: After breakfast we’ll gather for a Welcome Briefing at the hotel to go over the itinerary in detail, including any changes that may need to occur. Your Trip Experience Leader will also discuss logistics, safety procedures, and answer any questions you may have. Then, our Trip Experience Leader will take us for an orientation walk to gain familiarity with our surroundings and enjoy our first glimpse of local culture.

Lunch: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to begin exploring Dakar on your own. Or, you may want to join your Trip Experience Leader on a short bus ride to visit the IFAN Museum of African Arts. This prestigious museum houses one of the oldest and most noteworthy collections of West African art and artefacts, including ritual masks, clothing, weapons, and more.
After returning to our hotel, you’ll have a little time to relax before dinner.

Dinner: Sit down with your fellow travelers to enjoy a Welcome Dinner.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Perhaps you'll continue getting to know your fellow travelers over a nightcap in the hotel bar.

Day 4
Explore Dakar • Home-Hosted Dinner
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: Following breakfast, we’ll set out to explore Dakar, Senegal's vibrant capital city, with a local guide. Today's panoramic city tour will take you through bustling open-air markets and down streets where the vestiges of French colonial influence can still be seen in the architecture. As we'll see, Dakar is a city of contrasts, at once holding on to its history and traditions and boldly looking forward to meet the future.

We'll visit Independence Square, the central hub of the city. Then we'll pay our respects at the African Renaissance Monument, which was built in 2010 to commemorate 50 years of Senegalese Independence from France. At more than 160 feet in height, the monument is taller than both the Statue of Liberty and Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer.

We'll cap off our morning with a stop for bissap, a tea made from hibiscus and sugar that's a favorite among locals.

Lunch: On your own. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to explore on your own.

Dinner: This evening, we'll divide into smaller groups and drive to the homes of local families for a Home-Hosted Dinner to enjoy an authentic cultural exchange over a traditional Senegalese meal. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know the local people and learn about Senegalese culture. Ask your hosts any questions you may have about life in Dakar, the country's customs, or what employment and education opportunities are like.

Evening: We'll bid a fond farewell to our host families and return to the hotel, where the rest of the evening is yours to do as you'd like.

Day 5
Visit Gorée Island • Embark ship • Captain's Welcome Dinner
Destination: At sea
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Saint Charles, Gorée Island, Senegal
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: We'll board a bus to Dakar Harbor and take a ferry ride to Gorée Island. A major slave-trading center between the 15th and 19th centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site reminds visitors of the opulence and cruelty of the slave trade with its preserved colonial homes and slave quarters, where Africans were held before being shipped to the New World as slaves.

Here, we’ll view Saint Charles Church, as well as the poignant House of Slaves, where world leaders and popular figures like John Paul II, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, and the Jackson 5 have visited. We'll see the Door of No Return, which marks the slaves’ final stop before leaving Africa.

Lunch: On your own in Gorée Island. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: After returning to Dakar, we'll regroup and make our way to the docks, where we'll embark our home for the next 14 nights: the M/V Corinthian. This privately owned, 98-passenger vessel is staffed by a friendly, English-speaking crew who will be eager to welcome you aboard and show you to your room. Each of the ship’s outside-facing cabins features a window or balcony, flat-screen TV, air-conditioning, and its own private bath.

You'll have some time to settle in to your cabin and explore the ship's amenities before we participate in a safety briefing and a ship's welcome briefing. Then, gather with your Trip Experience Leader for the first of your nightly Port Talks.

Dinner: Sit down to a Captain's Welcome Dinner in the ship's dining room and toast to the voyage ahead. As with all the dinners during your cruise, the atmosphere is relaxed and the dress code is smart casual. You’ll be offered a choice of appetizer, soup, entrée, and dessert—including American favorites—and complimentary house beer, house wine, and soft drinks. (Half-portions are available upon request.) But at this special welcome reception, you'll also enjoy more elaborate dishes and a special cocktail. While the dress code at mealtimes is always relaxed and smart casual, some travelers opt to wear a day dress or slacks for the first dinner.

Evening: As our ship sets sail for the Cape Verde Islands, you're free to relax and spend the evening how you wish.

Explore Santiago Island, Cape Verde • Visit the Plateau
Destination: Santiago Island
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Praia City, Santiago Island, Cape Verde
Activity Note: The Cape Verde Islands offer motorcoaches with less room and lower standards than we are used to in the U.S. or Europe.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Step ashore on Santiago Island, the largest island of Cape Verde. Ringed by golden sands, gently lapping azure waters, and mountainous terrain, Santiago Island is home to some of the most diverse landscapes in all of Cape Verde.

We'll set out on a walking tour to explore the Plateau, the historic center of Santiago's capital city of Praia, featuring some of the most preserved buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Then, we'll visit Praia's market, a bustling market boasting colorful produce, handmade crafts, friendly locals, and more.

Next, we'll drive to Cidade Velha, one of Santiago's oldest settlements and Cape Verde's former capital. Here, we'll visit the fortress of São Filipe, built in the 16th century as part of the defense system for the city. Then, we'll go to the small village of Cidade Velha, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was formerly known as the town of Ribeira Grande, Europe's first colonial outpost in the tropics.

Following our Santiago explorations, we'll return to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to continue exploring on your own. There will be shuttle buses available for those who would like to return to the Plateau for their own discoveries.

Later this afternoon, enjoy a Port Talk onboard.

Dinner: Served in the ship's dining room.

Evening: Free to spend as you please.

Day 8
Sal • Explore salt mine • Visit Shark Bay • Botanical Garden
Destination: Sal
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Pedra de Lume salt mine, Sal Island, Cape Verde
Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Today's discoveries take us to Sal, an island whose name means "salt." And as we'll see during our time on Sal today, the island certainly lives up to its name.

Our first destination is the Pedra de Lume salt mine, which is located in the crater of an extinct volcano. Here, you'll have a chance to go for a swim in Lake Salinas, the second saltiest body of water (after the Dead Sea). The water's high salinity will allow you to float—and will leave your skin soft from the salt's scrubbing effect.

Next, we'll visit Buracona, a natural bay formed by the ocean and lava rocks.

Finally, we'll conclude our morning with a visit to Shark Bay, where you can spot small lemon sharks in in the shallow waters.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Arrive in Santo Antão, the westernmost island of Cape Verde that's known for its lush interior and verdant mountains.

We'll begin our day driving to Janela, Portuguese for "window." As one of the most scenic drives in all of Cape Verde, you'll see many villages nestled in the valley of the river Ribeira da Janela as we reach our next destination.

We'll enjoy a panoramic view from the crater's edge looking into the wide, grassy plain below; the interior of the crater is now used by farmers to grow crops. We'll stop along the way at a lookout point to view the lush landscapes from above.

While Pico de Fogo is technically considered an active volcano, its last eruption was more than 400 years ago. But the island is also home to another, more active volcano that erupted in 2014. As we explore Chã das Caldeiras, we'll have the opportunity to admire the views from inside the crater during a walk in the volcano's secondary caldera.

Day 1
Depart U.S.
Depart the U.S. today on an overnight flight bound for Dakar, Senegal.

Day 2
Arrive in Dakar, Senegal
Destination: Dakar
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: As the capital with 3 million inhabitants, anticipate chaotic traffic and a vibrant city stimulating all the senses.

This itinerary offers an off the beaten path experience. Expect coaches and hotels with lower standards than what we are used to in the U.S. and Europe. If you choose to join, a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace cultural differences is essential.

Morning/Afternoon: Depending on your individual flight arrangements, you'll arrive in Dakar, Senegal some time today. An O.A.T. representative will meet you at the airport and assist with your transfer to the hotel, where you'll meet your fellow travelers—including those who took our The Gulf of Guinea: Ghana, Togo & Benin pre-trip extension.

There, check in and enjoy some free time to relax and settle in. You may choose to join your Trip Experience Leader later for an optional orientation walk around the hotel's vicinity.

Dinner: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Head out to begin exploring Dakar on your own, or retire early after your day of traveling.

Day 3
Explore Dakar
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

African Renaissance Monument, Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: Expect encounters with beggars, particularly children, on the streets throughout your trip. It's not advisable to give anything individually, as it may create challenges when unable to provide for all. Consider alternative ways to support local communities, such as donating supplies to local organizations who offer aid to these communities, or ask your Trip Experience Leader where you can volunteer during free time.

Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: After breakfast we’ll gather for a Welcome Briefing at the hotel to go over the itinerary in detail, including any changes that may need to occur. Your Trip Experience Leader will also discuss logistics, safety procedures, and answer any questions you may have. Then, our Trip Experience Leader will take us for an orientation walk to gain familiarity with our surroundings and enjoy our first glimpse of local culture.

Lunch: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to begin exploring Dakar on your own. Or, you may want to join your Trip Experience Leader on a short bus ride to visit the IFAN Museum of African Arts.

After returning to our hotel, you’ll have a little time to relax before dinner.

Explore Dakar • Home-Hosted Dinner
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Today's panoramic city tour will take you through bustling open-air markets and down streets where the vestiges of French colonial influence can still be seen in the architecture. As we'll see, Dakar is a city of contrasts, at once holding on to its history and traditions and boldly looking forward to meet the future.

We'll visit Independence Square, the central hub of the city. Then we'll pay our respects at the African Renaissance Monument, which was built in 2010 to commemorate 50 years of Senegalese Independence from France. At more than 160 feet in height, the monument is taller than both the Statue of Liberty and Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer.

We'll cap off our morning with a stop for bissap, a tea made from hibiscus and sugar that's a favorite among locals.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to explore on your own.

Dinner: This evening, we'll divide into smaller groups and drive to the homes of local families for a Home-Hosted Dinner to enjoy an authentic cultural exchange over a traditional Senegalese meal. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know the local people and learn about Senegalese culture. Ask your hosts any questions you may have about life in Dakar, the country's customs, or what employment and education opportunities are like.

Evening: We'll bid a fond farewell to our host families and return to the hotel, where the rest of the evening is yours to do as you'd like.

Day 5
Visit Gorée Island • Embark ship • Captain's Welcome Dinner
Destination: At sea
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Saint Charles, Gorée Island, Senegal
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: We'll board a bus to Dakar Harbor and take a ferry ride to Gorée Island. A major slave-trading center between the 15th and 19th centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site reminds visitors of the opulence and cruelty of the slave trade with its preserved colonial homes and slave quarters, where Africans were held before being shipped to the New World as slaves.

Here, we’ll view Saint Charles Church, as well as the poignant House of Slaves, where world leaders and popular figures like John Paul II, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, and the Jackson 5 have visited. We'll see the Door of No Return, which marks the slaves’ final stop before leaving Africa.

Lunch: On your own in Gorée Island. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: After returning to Dakar, we'll regroup and make our way to the docks, where we'll embark our home for the next 14 nights: the M/V Corinthian. This privately owned, 98-passenger vessel is staffed by a friendly, English-speaking crew who will be eager to welcome you aboard and show you to your room. Each of the ship’s outside-facing cabins features a window or balcony, flat-screen TV, air-conditioning, and its own private bath.

You'll have some time to settle in to your cabin and explore the ship's amenities before we participate in a safety briefing and a ship's welcome briefing. Then, gather with your Trip Experience Leader for the first of your nightly Port Talks.

Dinner: Sit down to a Captain's Welcome Dinner in the ship's dining room and toast to the voyage ahead. As with all the dinners during your cruise, the atmosphere is relaxed and the dress code is smart casual. You’ll be offered a choice of appetizer, soup, entrée, and dessert—including American favorites—and complimentary house beer, house wine, and soft drinks. (Half-portions are available upon request.) But at this special welcome reception, you'll also enjoy more elaborate dishes and a special cocktail. While the dress code at mealtimes is always relaxed and smart casual, some travelers opt to wear a day dress or slacks for the first dinner.

Evening: As our ship sets sail for the Cape Verde Islands, you're free to relax and spend the evening how you wish.

Destination: Santiago Island
Meals included: B L D

Activity Note: The Cape Verde Islands offer motorcoaches with less room and lower standards than we are used to in the U.S. or Europe.

Morning: Step ashore on Santiago Island, the largest island of Cape Verde. Ringed by golden sands, gently lapping azure waters, and mountainous terrain, Santiago Island is home to some of the most diverse landscapes in all of Cape Verde.

We'll set out on a walking tour to explore the Plateau, the historic center of Santiago's capital city of Praia, featuring some of the most preserved buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Then, we'll visit Praia's market, a bustling market boasting colorful produce, handmade crafts, friendly locals, and more.

Next, we'll drive to Cidade Velha, one of Santiago's oldest settlements and Cape Verde's former capital. Here, we'll visit the fortress of São Filipe, built in the 16th century as part of the defense system for the city. Then, we'll go to the small village of Cidade Velha, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was formerly known as the town of Ribeira Grande, Europe's first colonial outpost in the tropics.

Following our Santiago explorations, we'll return to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to continue exploring on your own. There will be shuttle buses available for those who would like to return to the Plateau for their own discoveries.

Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Pedra de Lume salt mine, Sal Island, Cape Verde
Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Today's discoveries take us to Sal, an island whose name means "salt." And as we'll see during our time on Sal today, the island certainly lives up to its name.

Our first destination is the Pedra de Lume salt mine, which is located in the crater of an extinct volcano. Here, you'll have a chance to go for a swim in Lake Salinas, the second saltiest body of water (after the Dead Sea). The water's high salinity will allow you to float—and will leave your skin soft from the salt's scrubbing effect.

Next, we'll visit Buracona, a natural bay formed by the ocean and lava rocks.

Finally, we'll conclude our morning with a visit to Shark Bay, where you can spot small lemon sharks in in the shallow waters.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: Cap off your Sal discoveries with a visit to a botanical garden and eco-park. As you stroll through the garden, you can admire local and exotic flora and fauna, including colorful parrots. The park also places an emphasis on recycling and environmental stewardship.

Back aboard your ship, enjoy a Port Talk before dinner.

Dinner: Served in the ship's dining room.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Arrive in Santo Antão, the westernmost island of Cape Verde that's known for its lush interior and verdant mountains.

We'll begin our day driving to Janela, Portuguese for "window." As one of the most scenic drives in all of Cape Verde, you'll see many villages nestled in the valley of the river Ribeira da Janela as we reach our next destination. Today, we'll visit one of these villages and meet with a local farmers community to learn about the irrigation systems that have been used for decades here, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of their way of life on the land.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: The afternoon is at your leisure. You might use the opportunity to discover Porto Novo on your own. Or, perhaps you'll read a book on the Sun Deck, or relax in your room before joining your Trip Experience Leader for tonight's Port Talk.

We'll stop along the way at a lookout point to view the lush landscapes from above.

Teide Observatory, a major international astronomical observatory, is located on the slopes of the mountain. We’ll pause a few times to take in sweeping views of the island beginning with the lunar-like landscape surrounding Mount Teide. Teide National Park is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

Morning: We'll drive to San Cristóbal de la Laguna—a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Upon arrival, we’ll stroll the city’s wide streets and open squares, which have a number of churches and buildings dating from the 16th century. San Cristóbal de La Laguna is the first example of an unfortified town with a grid model that was the direct precursor of the settlements in the Americas under Spanish rule during colonial times. This town is a living example of the exchange of influences between European and American cultures.

We’ll next head to Garachico Harbor, its modern port a striking contrast to the nearby historic Old Town. We'll explore Garachio, walking past the former port that was buried by a volcanic eruption in the 18th century.

Morning: Stroll Santa Cruz de La Palma this morning, the capital city of the island of La Palma, and admire its famous centuries-old architecture, cobblestone streets, and lively port on a discovery walk with your Trip Experience Leader.

For those embarking on the tour to the volcano, travelers will split into smaller groups and will be joined by a local guide who will explain how the most recent volcanic eruptions have altered the islands’ geology. Learn how a recent eruption was active for three months and during that time destroyed more than 3,000 properties and hundreds of acres of farmland on the island. Plus, hear how the molten rock which poured into the ocean increased the size of the island.

Arrive in Dakar, Senegal
Destination: Dakar
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: As the capital with 3 million inhabitants, anticipate chaotic traffic and a vibrant city stimulating all the senses.

This itinerary offers an off the beaten path experience. Expect coaches and hotels with lower standards than what we are used to in the U.S. and Europe. If you choose to join, a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace cultural differences is essential.

Morning/Afternoon: Depending on your individual flight arrangements, you'll arrive in Dakar, Senegal some time today. An O.A.T. representative will meet you at the airport and assist with your transfer to the hotel, where you'll meet your fellow travelers—including those who took our The Gulf of Guinea: Ghana, Togo & Benin pre-trip extension.

There, check in and enjoy some free time to relax and settle in. You may choose to join your Trip Experience Leader later for an optional orientation walk around the hotel's vicinity.

Dinner: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Head out to begin exploring Dakar on your own, or retire early after your day of traveling.

Day 3
Explore Dakar
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

African Renaissance Monument, Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: Expect encounters with beggars, particularly children, on the streets throughout your trip. It's not advisable to give anything individually, as it may create challenges when unable to provide for all. Consider alternative ways to support local communities, such as donating supplies to local organizations who offer aid to these communities, or ask your Trip Experience Leader where you can volunteer during free time.

Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: After breakfast we’ll gather for a Welcome Briefing at the hotel to go over the itinerary in detail, including any changes that may need to occur. Your Trip Experience Leader will also discuss logistics, safety procedures, and answer any questions you may have. Then, our Trip Experience Leader will take us for an orientation walk to gain familiarity with our surroundings and enjoy our first glimpse of local culture.

Lunch: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to begin exploring Dakar on your own. Or, you may want to join your Trip Experience Leader on a short bus ride to visit the IFAN Museum of African Arts.

After returning to our hotel, you’ll have a little time to relax before dinner.

Day 4
Explore Dakar • Home-Hosted Dinner
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: Following breakfast, we’ll set out to explore Dakar, Senegal's vibrant capital city, with a local guide. Today's panoramic city tour will take you through bustling open-air markets and down streets where the vestiges of French colonial influence can still be seen in the architecture. As we'll see, Dakar is a city of contrasts, at once holding on to its history and traditions and boldly looking forward to meet the future.

We'll visit Independence Square, the central hub of the city. Then we'll pay our respects at the African Renaissance Monument, which was built in 2010 to commemorate 50 years of Senegalese Independence from France. At more than 160 feet in height, the monument is taller than both the Statue of Liberty and Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer.

We'll cap off our morning with a stop for bissap, a tea made from hibiscus and sugar that's a favorite among locals.

Lunch: On your own. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to explore on your own.

Dinner: This evening, we'll divide into smaller groups and drive to the homes of local families for a Home-Hosted Dinner to enjoy an authentic cultural exchange over a traditional Senegalese meal. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know the local people and learn about Senegalese culture. Ask your hosts any questions you may have about life in Dakar, the country's customs, or what employment and education opportunities are like.

Evening: We'll bid a fond farewell to our host families and return to the hotel, where the rest of the evening is yours to do as you'd like.

Day 5
Visit Gorée Island • Embark ship • Captain's Welcome Dinner
Destination: At sea
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Saint Charles, Gorée Island, Senegal
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: We'll board a bus to Dakar Harbor and take a ferry ride to Gorée Island. A major slave-trading center between the 15th and 19th centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site reminds visitors of the opulence and cruelty of the slave trade with its preserved colonial homes and slave quarters, where Africans were held before being shipped to the New World as slaves.

Here, we’ll view Saint Charles Church, as well as the poignant House of Slaves, where world leaders and popular figures like John Paul II, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, and the Jackson 5 have visited. We'll see the Door of No Return, which marks the slaves’ final stop before leaving Africa.

Lunch: On your own in Gorée Island. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: After returning to Dakar, we'll regroup and make our way to the docks, where we'll embark our home for the next 14 nights: the M/V Corinthian. This privately owned, 98-passenger vessel is staffed by a friendly, English-speaking crew who will be eager to welcome you aboard and show you to your room. Each of the ship’s outside-facing cabins features a window or balcony, flat-screen TV, air-conditioning, and its own private bath.

You'll have some time to settle in to your cabin and explore the ship's amenities before we participate in a safety briefing and a ship's welcome briefing. Then, gather with your Trip Experience Leader for the first of your nightly Port Talks.

Dinner: Sit down to a Captain's Welcome Dinner in the ship's dining room and toast to the voyage ahead. As with all the dinners during your cruise, the atmosphere is relaxed and the dress code is smart casual. You’ll be offered a choice of appetizer, soup, entrée, and dessert—including American favorites—and complimentary house beer, house wine, and soft drinks. (Half-portions are available upon request.) But at this special welcome reception, you'll also enjoy more elaborate dishes and a special cocktail. While the dress code at mealtimes is always relaxed and smart casual, some travelers opt to wear a day dress or slacks for the first dinner.

Evening: As our ship sets sail for the Cape Verde Islands, you're free to relax and spend the evening how you wish.

Praia City, Santiago Island, Cape Verde
Activity Note: The Cape Verde Islands offer motorcoaches with less room and lower standards than we are used to in the U.S. or Europe.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Step ashore on Santiago Island, the largest island of Cape Verde. Ringed by golden sands, gently lapping azure waters, and mountainous terrain, Santiago Island is home to some of the most diverse landscapes in all of Cape Verde.

We'll set out on a walking tour to explore the Plateau, the historic center of Santiago's capital city of Praia, featuring some of the most preserved buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Then, we'll visit Praia's market, a bustling market boasting colorful produce, handmade crafts, friendly locals, and more.

Next, we'll drive to Cidade Velha, one of Santiago's oldest settlements and Cape Verde's former capital. Here, we'll visit the fortress of São Filipe, built in the 16th century as part of the defense system for the city. Then, we'll go to the small village of Cidade Velha, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was formerly known as the town of Ribeira Grande, Europe's first colonial outpost in the tropics.

Following our Santiago explorations, we'll return to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Day 8
Sal • Explore salt mine • Visit Shark Bay • Botanical Garden

Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Pedra de Lume salt mine, Sal Island, Cape Verde
Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Today's discoveries take us to Sal, an island whose name means "salt." And as we'll see during our time on Sal today, the island certainly lives up to its name.

Our first destination is the Pedra de Lume salt mine, which is located in the crater of an extinct volcano. Here, you'll have a chance to go for a swim in Lake Salinas, the second saltiest body of water (after the Dead Sea). The water's high salinity will allow you to float—and will leave your skin soft from the salt's scrubbing effect.

Next, we'll visit Buracona, a natural bay formed by the ocean and lava rocks.

Finally, we'll conclude our morning with a visit to Shark Bay, where you can spot small lemon sharks in in the shallow waters.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: Cap off your Sal discoveries with a visit to a botanical garden and eco-park. As you stroll through the garden, you can admire local and exotic flora and fauna, including colorful parrots. The park also places an emphasis on recycling and environmental stewardship.

Back aboard your ship, enjoy a Port Talk before dinner.

Dinner: Served in the ship's dining room.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like.

Day 9
Santo Antão • Visit village of Janela
Destination: Santo Antão
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Paul Valley, Santo Antão, Cape Verde
Activity Note: Today's visit to a local Janela village involves uneven paths, going up and down the hill, and many high and uneven steps (up to 330 steps). Please keep in mind that this activity will be rigorous during some points.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Arrive in Santo Antão, the westernmost island of Cape Verde that's known for its lush interior and verdant mountains.

We'll begin our day driving to Janela, Portuguese for "window." As one of the most scenic drives in all of Cape Verde, you'll see many villages nestled in the valley of the river Ribeira da Janela as we reach our next destination. Today, we'll visit one of these villages and meet with a local farmers community to learn about the irrigation systems that have been used for decades here, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of their way of life on the land.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: The afternoon is at your leisure. You might use the opportunity to discover Porto Novo on your own. Or, perhaps you'll read a book on the Sun Deck, or relax in your room before joining your Trip Experience Leader for tonight's Port Talk.

Then, we'll continue our drive as we cross Cova National Park, filled with rugged mountains. But perhaps the biggest draw is Cova de Paúl, the largest volcanic crater in all of Cape Verde. We'll enjoy a panoramic view from the crater's edge looking into the wide, grassy plain below; the interior of the crater is now used by farmers to grow crops. We'll stop along the way at a lookout point to view the lush landscapes from above.

Later, we'll head back to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dinning room.

Activity Note: Fogo Island is only accessible by Zodiac craft. Conditions for such travel may vary depending on the visit.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Arrive by Zodiac crafts to explore the volcanic island of Fogo, whose name means "fire" in Portuguese. We'll begin our morning discovering the colorful architecture and colonial houses of São Filipe. Fogo was first discovered by Portuguese explorers during the 15th century, and you'll see evidence of their continued legacy in the town's architecture.

Then, we'll drive to Chã das Caldeiras, a small community located inside the Pico de Fogo volcanic crater. While Pico de Fogo is technically considered an active volcano, its last eruption was more than 400 years ago. But the island is also home to another, more active volcano that erupted in 2014. As we explore Chã das Caldeiras, we'll have the opportunity to admire the views from inside the crater during a walk in the volcano's secondary caldera. We will learn more about the island's geology on a walk that takes us over a lava field. The village's agricultural community in Chã is famous for its production of volcanic wine, and is the only area in Cape Verde that grows grapes and produces export-quality wine. We'll have the opportunity to tour one of the wine cellars.

Lunch: At the Chã das Caldeiras village.

Afternoon: Free to continue exploring Fogo on your own. You might like to revisit Ponta da Salina and relax in the nearby natural rock coves, perfect for calm swimming waters.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Today we'll explore Banjul, the capital city of the tiny West African nation of The Gambia. Banjul is also the least populated of any African capital, giving it a laidback feel that's amplified by its dusty red roads and colorful, if fading, colonial architecture.

We'll kick off our discoveries with a visit to the Tanji Fishing Center, where locals come to buy, sell, and smoke fish caught in the nearby waters. It's thought that more than 2,000 people participate in fishing-related activities here each day.

After watching the preparation of smoked fish, we'll enjoy a cooking class at Yabouy Home Cooking, home of Ida Cham Njai and have the opportunity to learn how to prepare a traditional Gambian meal.

Lunch: Sit down with Ida to enjoy the fruits of your labor: an authentic West African meal.

Afternoon: We'll continue our drive inland to reach Kachikally, a crocodile-infested pool that's traditionally used for sacred fertility rituals. More than 100 crocodiles are said to have made their home in Kachikally's waters. While here, we'll learn more about the native Bakau people and their spiritual belief system.

We'll return to ship by mid-afternoon. You'll have a few hours to settle in and relax before your nightly Port Talk.

Dinner: Served in the ship's dining room.

Evening: Free to do whatever you'd like.

Collapse All Days
 PRINT ALL
﻿
Day 1
Depart U.S.
Depart the U.S. today on an overnight flight bound for Dakar, Senegal.

Day 2
Arrive in Dakar, Senegal
Destination: Dakar
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: As the capital with 3 million inhabitants, anticipate chaotic traffic and a vibrant city stimulating all the senses.

This itinerary offers an off the beaten path experience. Expect coaches and hotels with lower standards than what we are used to in the U.S. and Europe. If you choose to join, a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace cultural differences is essential.

Morning/Afternoon: Depending on your individual flight arrangements, you'll arrive in Dakar, Senegal some time today. An O.A.T. representative will meet you at the airport and assist with your transfer to the hotel, where you'll meet your fellow travelers—including those who took our The Gulf of Guinea: Ghana, Togo & Benin pre-trip extension.

There, check in and enjoy some free time to relax and settle in. You may choose to join your Trip Experience Leader later for an optional orientation walk around the hotel's vicinity.

Dinner: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Head out to begin exploring Dakar on your own, or retire early after your day of traveling.

Day 3
Explore Dakar
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga

African Renaissance Monument, Dakar, Senegal
Activity Note: Expect encounters with beggars, particularly children, on the streets throughout your trip. It's not advisable to give anything individually, as it may create challenges when unable to provide for all. Consider alternative ways to support local communities, such as donating supplies to local organizations who offer aid to these communities, or ask your Trip Experience Leader where you can volunteer during free time.

Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: After breakfast we’ll gather for a Welcome Briefing at the hotel to go over the itinerary in detail, including any changes that may need to occur. Your Trip Experience Leader will also discuss logistics, safety procedures, and answer any questions you may have. Then, our Trip Experience Leader will take us for an orientation walk to gain familiarity with our surroundings and enjoy our first glimpse of local culture.

Lunch: On your own. Check with your Trip Experience Leader for suggestions.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to begin exploring Dakar on your own. Or, you may want to join your Trip Experience Leader on a short bus ride to visit the IFAN Museum of African Arts. This prestigious museum houses one of the oldest and most noteworthy collections of West African art and artefacts, including ritual masks, clothing, weapons, and more.
After returning to our hotel, you’ll have a little time to relax before dinner.

Dinner: Sit down with your fellow travelers to enjoy a Welcome Dinner.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like. Perhaps you'll continue getting to know your fellow travelers over a nightcap in the hotel bar.

Day 4
Explore Dakar • Home-Hosted Dinner
Destination: Dakar
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: Pullman Dakar Teranga
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: Following breakfast, we’ll set out to explore Dakar, Senegal's vibrant capital city, with a local guide. Today's panoramic city tour will take you through bustling open-air markets and down streets where the vestiges of French colonial influence can still be seen in the architecture. As we'll see, Dakar is a city of contrasts, at once holding on to its history and traditions and boldly looking forward to meet the future.

We'll visit Independence Square, the central hub of the city. Then we'll pay our respects at the African Renaissance Monument, which was built in 2010 to commemorate 50 years of Senegalese Independence from France. At more than 160 feet in height, the monument is taller than both the Statue of Liberty and Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer.

We'll cap off our morning with a stop for bissap, a tea made from hibiscus and sugar that's a favorite among locals.

Lunch: On your own. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: Your afternoon is free to explore on your own.

Dinner: This evening, we'll divide into smaller groups and drive to the homes of local families for a Home-Hosted Dinner to enjoy an authentic cultural exchange over a traditional Senegalese meal. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know the local people and learn about Senegalese culture. Ask your hosts any questions you may have about life in Dakar, the country's customs, or what employment and education opportunities are like.

Evening: We'll bid a fond farewell to our host families and return to the hotel, where the rest of the evening is yours to do as you'd like.

Day 5
Visit Gorée Island • Embark ship • Captain's Welcome Dinner
Destination: At sea
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Saint Charles, Gorée Island, Senegal
Breakfast: At the hotel.

Morning: We'll board a bus to Dakar Harbor and take a ferry ride to Gorée Island. A major slave-trading center between the 15th and 19th centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site reminds visitors of the opulence and cruelty of the slave trade with its preserved colonial homes and slave quarters, where Africans were held before being shipped to the New World as slaves.

Here, we’ll view Saint Charles Church, as well as the poignant House of Slaves, where world leaders and popular figures like John Paul II, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, and the Jackson 5 have visited. We'll see the Door of No Return, which marks the slaves’ final stop before leaving Africa.

Lunch: On your own in Gorée Island. You might like to try ceebu jën, a fish and rice dish that's a staple in Senegal.

Afternoon: After returning to Dakar, we'll regroup and make our way to the docks, where we'll embark our home for the next 14 nights: the M/V Corinthian. This privately owned, 98-passenger vessel is staffed by a friendly, English-speaking crew who will be eager to welcome you aboard and show you to your room. Each of the ship’s outside-facing cabins features a window or balcony, flat-screen TV, air-conditioning, and its own private bath.

You'll have some time to settle in to your cabin and explore the ship's amenities before we participate in a safety briefing and a ship's welcome briefing. Then, gather with your Trip Experience Leader for the first of your nightly Port Talks.

Dinner: Sit down to a Captain's Welcome Dinner in the ship's dining room and toast to the voyage ahead. As with all the dinners during your cruise, the atmosphere is relaxed and the dress code is smart casual. You’ll be offered a choice of appetizer, soup, entrée, and dessert—including American favorites—and complimentary house beer, house wine, and soft drinks. (Half-portions are available upon request.) But at this special welcome reception, you'll also enjoy more elaborate dishes and a special cocktail. While the dress code at mealtimes is always relaxed and smart casual, some travelers opt to wear a day dress or slacks for the first dinner.

Evening: As our ship sets sail for the Cape Verde Islands, you're free to relax and spend the evening how you wish.

Destination: At sea
Meals included: B L D

Explore Santiago Island, Cape Verde • Visit the Plateau
Destination: Santiago Island
Meals included: B L D

Praia City, Santiago Island, Cape Verde
Activity Note: The Cape Verde Islands offer motorcoaches with less room and lower standards than we are used to in the U.S. or Europe.

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Step ashore on Santiago Island, the largest island of Cape Verde. Ringed by golden sands, gently lapping azure waters, and mountainous terrain, Santiago Island is home to some of the most diverse landscapes in all of Cape Verde.

We'll set out on a walking tour to explore the Plateau, the historic center of Santiago's capital city of Praia, featuring some of the most preserved buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Then, we'll visit Praia's market, a bustling market boasting colorful produce, handmade crafts, friendly locals, and more.

Next, we'll drive to Cidade Velha, one of Santiago's oldest settlements and Cape Verde's former capital. Here, we'll visit the fortress of São Filipe, built in the 16th century as part of the defense system for the city. Then, we'll go to the small village of Cidade Velha, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was formerly known as the town of Ribeira Grande, Europe's first colonial outpost in the tropics.

Following our Santiago explorations, we'll return to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Sal • Explore salt mine • Visit Shark Bay • Botanical Garden

Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Pedra de Lume salt mine, Sal Island, Cape Verde
Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Today's discoveries take us to Sal, an island whose name means "salt." And as we'll see during our time on Sal today, the island certainly lives up to its name.

Our first destination is the Pedra de Lume salt mine, which is located in the crater of an extinct volcano. Here, you'll have a chance to go for a swim in Lake Salinas, the second saltiest body of water (after the Dead Sea). The water's high salinity will allow you to float—and will leave your skin soft from the salt's scrubbing effect.

Next, we'll visit Buracona, a natural bay formed by the ocean and lava rocks.

Finally, we'll conclude our morning with a visit to Shark Bay, where you can spot small lemon sharks in in the shallow waters.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: Cap off your Sal discoveries with a visit to a botanical garden and eco-park. As you stroll through the garden, you can admire local and exotic flora and fauna, including colorful parrots. The park also places an emphasis on recycling and environmental stewardship.

Back aboard your ship, enjoy a Port Talk before dinner.

Dinner: Served in the ship's dining room.

Evening: Free to do as you'd like.

Destination: Santo Antão
Meals included: B L D
Accommodations: M/V Corinthian

Paul Valley, Santo Antão, Cape Verde

Breakfast: Served in the ship's dining room.

Morning: Arrive in Santo Antão, the westernmost island of Cape Verde that's known for its lush interior and verdant mountains.

We'll begin our day driving to Janela, Portuguese for "window." As one of the most scenic drives in all of Cape Verde, you'll see many villages nestled in the valley of the river Ribeira da Janela as we reach our next destination. Today, we'll visit one of these villages and meet with a local farmers community to learn about the irrigation systems that have been used for decades here, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of their way of life on the land.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dining room.

Afternoon: The afternoon is at your leisure. You might use the opportunity to discover Porto Novo on your own. Or, perhaps you'll read a book on the Sun Deck, or relax in your room before joining your Trip Experience Leader for tonight's Port Talk.

Evening: Free to make your own discoveries.

Day 10
Santo Antão • Estrada A Corda scenic drive

Then, we'll continue our drive as we cross Cova National Park, filled with rugged mountains. But perhaps the biggest draw is Cova de Paúl, the largest volcanic crater in all of Cape Verde. We'll enjoy a panoramic view from the crater's edge looking into the wide, grassy plain below; the interior of the crater is now used by farmers to grow crops. We'll stop along the way at a lookout point to view the lush landscapes from above.

Later, we'll head back to the ship.

Lunch: Served in the ship's dinning room.

We'll begin our morning discovering the colorful architecture and colonial houses of São Filipe. Fogo was first discovered by Portuguese explorers during the 15th century, and you'll see evidence of their continued legacy in the town's architecture.

Then, we'll drive to Chã das Caldeiras, a small community located inside the Pico de Fogo volcanic crater. While Pico de Fogo is technically considered an active volcano, its last eruption was more than 400 years ago. But the island is also home to another, more active volcano that erupted in 2014. As we explore Chã das Caldeiras, we'll have the opportunity to admire the views from inside the crater during a walk in the volcano's secondary caldera. We will learn more about the island's geology on a walk that takes us over a lava field.

We'll kick off our discoveries with a visit to the Tanji Fishing Center, where locals come to buy, sell, and smoke fish caught in the nearby waters. It's thought that more than 2,000 people participate in fishing-related activities here each day.

After watching the preparation of smoked fish, we'll enjoy a cooking class at Yabouy Home Cooking, home of Ida Cham Njai and have the opportunity to learn how to prepare a traditional Gambian meal.

Lunch: Sit down with Ida to enjoy the fruits of your labor: an authentic West African meal.

Afternoon: We'll continue our drive inland to reach Kachikally, a crocodile-infested pool that's traditionally used for sacred fertility rituals.

After, you may like to try a toboggan ride, a traditional basket sledge that was a popular means of transportation for the locals back in the early 19th century.

Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain
Breakfast: Served onboard in the ship’s dining room.

We’ll also have the opportunity to feel the Earth’s heat during a geothermal demonstration in the park’s welcome center. Next, we’ll drive along Ruta de los Volcanes (Volcano Route) where we’ll witness the area’s unique moon-like landscape.

After our visit here, we’ll drive along the Timanfaya coast, stopping along the way at El Golfo, a fishing village within Volcanoes National Park. We’ll find charming Lanzarote-style fishing houses with whitewashed walls and flat roofs, surrounded by miles of hardened lava left over from the eruptions of the early 1700s.

Our next destination will be a nearby winery that uses the volcanic soil to its advantage in the cultivation of its grapes. This mineral-rich soil—almost completely black—yields grapes used in vintages such as Malvasia, the most typical wine of Lanzarote. We’ll learn about their meticulous hand-harvesting process as well as enjoy a tasting. After our visit, we will drive back to our ship.

Lunch: Served onboard in the ship’s dining room.

From here, we can appreciate the unique topography of El Río, a narrow strip of sea that divides Lanzarote from La Graciosa, the eighth Canary Island.

After our visit, we’ll drive to the Cactus Garden, a unique and vast garden situated in a former quarry and home to over 1,000 species of cactus from around the world. Wander through this immersive garden full of plants ranging from small succulents to towering cacti.

Before returning to the ship, join our Trip Experience Leader for a discovery walk in the historical town of Teguise, the former capital of Lanzarote and one of the first settlements established in the Canary Islands. Teguise's Old Town is one of the oldest villages and is rich with historical architecture.

Lunch: Served onboard in your ship’s dining room.

Afternoon: Next, we’ll visit the César Manrique Foundation, located at the site of a lava dome formed during a series of volcanic eruptions that rocked the island between 1730 and 1736. Headquartered in the tranquil and serene Volcano House, the foundation was created by artist and architect César Manrique in 1968 using the natural volcanic landscape as part of the home’s design. As you explore, take note of how Manrique honored the violent aspects of nature by blending it seamlessly with the architectural elements.

Later on, we’ll once again gather in the ship's lounge for our Port Talk.

In fact, Teide's elevation above sea level makes Tenerife the tenth highest island in the world. Teide Observatory, a major international astronomical observatory, is located on the slopes of the mountain. We’ll pause a few times to take in sweeping views of the island beginning with the lunar-like landscape surrounding Mount Teide. Teide National Park is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

Our next stop along the way will be at Minas de San José, a mine deposit peppered with unique valleys and rock formations. Then we'll head to Roques de García, one of the most exceptional rock formations found in Mount Teide's National Park.

After, we'll continue our drive to Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Lunch: Served onboard in the ship's dining room.

Morning: We'll drive to San Cristóbal de la Laguna—a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Upon arrival, we’ll stroll the city’s wide streets and open squares, which have a number of churches and buildings dating from the 16th century. San Cristóbal de La Laguna is the first example of an unfortified town with a grid model that was the direct precursor of the settlements in the Americas under Spanish rule during colonial times. This town is a living example of the exchange of influences between European and American cultures.

We’ll next head to Garachico Harbor, its modern port a striking contrast to the nearby historic Old Town. We'll explore Garachio, walking past the former port that was buried by a volcanic eruption in the 18th century.

For those embarking on the tour to the volcano, travelers will split into smaller groups and will be joined by a local guide who will explain how the most recent volcanic eruptions have altered the islands’ geology. Learn how a recent eruption was active for three months and during that time destroyed more than 3,000 properties and hundreds of acres of farmland on the island. Plus, hear how the molten rock which poured into the ocean increased the size of the island.

Cochineals are parasitic insects that live on cacti and are bred and harvested to extract carmine, a natural reddish dye used in cosmetics, food, textiles, and more. We'll try our hand at gathering some cochineal before driving over to the drying room, where we'll learn about the final process of extracting carmine and using the dye to make our own watercolors.

Description of West African history tour in Ghana
Ghana has a vibrant cultural identity and has been inhabited for over 300,000 years, it’s current ethnographic composition are results from constant migration from the North and Eastern parts of Africa, mainly due to the abundance of Gold in the region. This Cultural diversity is evident with over 75 African dialects spoken in current day Ghana.

European settlers were initially lured here by the trade in Ivory and Gold. But sadly, this was soon to be replaced by the tragic trade in human cargo, bound for the rapidly increasing number of plantations in the Americas. Ghana was exporting enslaved Africans at a far greater rate than any other West African country; this is evident with over 20 castles and Fortifications still dotting the Coastline. West Africans from Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Niger, Burkina Faso and other countries were transported through these Fortifications in Ghana.

Many African Americans and West Indians have traced their roots back to Ghana, and have made the emotional journey tracing the steps their ancestors were forced to make all those years ago. For many, this is an emotional, thought provoking experience and the majority have an overwhelming feeling that they have come home.

Benefited local economy.

4. Finally, how would you rate your holiday overall?

Average to very good. Guides and drivers attached to their cell phones at lunch and I didn't bring one. Felt left out much of the time because the person I went with was so extroverted and assertive. Didn't feel listened to much of the time. However trip was very well organized and went smoothly. Excellent guides and driver.

From sprawling beaches to lunar-like landscapes, holidays to Cape Verde line up stellar scenery – not to mention year-round sun.

The Cape Verde Islands
Cape Verde is located off the west coast of Africa, and is made up of 10 islands floating in the Atlantic Ocean. It takes around six hours to fly here from the UK, and year-round sun means there's plenty of choice for when to go. They’re still fairly new to the travel circuit, which makes them a great pick for off-the-beaten-track breaks. But with their long sandy beaches, lively surf and modern hotels, they’re quickly making a name for themselves.

Sal
Cape Verde’s most popular island is Sal, which is known for its striking, moon-like landscape. It’s dotted with colourful, cobbled towns, like Santa Maria in the south, where you’ll find surf shops, traditional restaurants and a square lined with al fresco cafés. The main attraction, though, is the beach, which stretches out for eight kilometres. Watersports are a big draw, but the sea can sometimes get a little choppy, so sunbathing's a popular fallback.

Boa Vista
You’ll find plenty more in the way of beaches over on Boa Vista, which translates to ‘beautiful view’. In fact, the sugar-coloured sands here halo the coastline for 55 uninterrupted kilometres. Praia Chave deserves a special mention, thanks to its creamy swathes and shape-shifting dunes.

Cultural melting pot
Whichever island you opt for, expect a melting pot of cultures. The Portuguese originally discovered Cape Verde, so there’s a mixture of African, Brazilian and Portuguese influences. You’ll see it in the island’s music, fashion and – perhaps most clearly – the food.

Cape Verde airport tax included on all package holidays
All our package holidays to Cape Verde come with your airport tax included, so you can avoid paying cash on arrival when you reach passport control. It’s all covered in your holiday bundle. Just so you know, airport tax isn’t included with flight only bookings.

Holidays to Senegal show off Africa’s next big name, where beaches along the continent’s sand-covered west coast serve as the centre of attention.

Dive in to Dakar
Dakar – Senegal’s colourful capital city – is where you’ll see most of the country’s culture on show. Its bustling centre’s home to everything from museums and galleries to nightclubs and open-air markets. The former two are where you can get to know a bit about Senegal’s history, and in the latter you'll see brightly coloured fabrics and fully laden fruit stalls competing for sales.

Peruse Pointe Sarene
Head two hours down the coast from Dakar and you’ll find one of Senegal’s up-and-coming resorts – Pointe Sarene. This sleepy fishing village is getting a massive holiday makeover, with a collection of huge hotels and over 200 luxury villas being built along its six-mile-long beachfront. The crowds haven’t picked up on Pointe Sarene's potential yet, so you can be one of the first to spread out on its postcard-worthy coast.

No shortage of nature
Senegal has six national parks up its sleeve, the easiest of which to get your hands on is Saloum Delta National Park – it’s 20 miles south of Pointe Sarene. This sprawling reserve stretches out for more than 440,000 acres, and is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The delta’s saltwater canals and forest-wrapped wetlands are home to hundreds of species of birds, including flamingos, terns and spoonbills – you might be able to spot them during a guided cruise around a portion of the park.
