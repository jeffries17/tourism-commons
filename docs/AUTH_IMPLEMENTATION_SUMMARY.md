# Authentication Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete Google Sheets-based authentication system for the Digital Assessment Dashboard with login tracking and role-based access control.

---

## Files Created

### Backend (`digital_assessment/functions/src/`)
- **app.ts** (updated)
  - Added `AuthUser` interface
  - Added `readAuthSheet()` function - reads users from Google Sheet
  - Added `updateLoginCount()` function - tracks logins
  - Added `POST /auth/login` endpoint - validates users

### Frontend (`digital_assessment/dashboard/src/`)

#### Types
- `types/auth.ts` - User and AuthContext type definitions

#### Contexts
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Global authentication state management
  - `login()` - Authenticate user
  - `logout()` - Clear session
  - `isAuthenticated` - Check if logged in
  - `isAdmin` - Check if user is admin
  - Persists session in localStorage

#### Pages
- `pages/Login.tsx` - Login form with username input

#### Components
- `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route wrapper requiring authentication
  - Supports `adminOnly` prop for admin-only routes
- `components/ParticipantRedirect.tsx` - Redirects participants to their detail page
- `components/layout/Header.tsx` (updated) - Shows user info and logout button

#### App
- `App.tsx` (updated)
  - Wrapped with `AuthProvider`
  - Added `/login` route (public)
  - Protected all existing routes
  - Admin-only routes for dashboard, participants, sectors, etc.
  - Role-based navigation

#### Pages Updated
- `pages/ParticipantDetail.tsx` (updated)
  - Added access control: participants can only view their own page

## Google Sheet Setup

**Sheet ID:** `1yxzgYWme1xW9uMX3jSz6t9BFI-tdV14UVmPiDjW_XCM`  
**Tab Name:** `dashboard_auth`

**Structure:**
| Column | Content | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A | Name of User/Organization | Alex Jeffries |
| B | User Name | ajeffries |
| C | Role | admin |
| D | Notes | ITC Team - Full access |
| E | login_count | 5 |
| F | last_login | 2025-10-10T14:30:00.000Z |

**Users Added:**
- 3 Admin users (ITC team)
- 61 CI Assessment participants
- 23 TO Assessment participants
- **Total: 87 users**

---

## Authentication Flow

```
User visits site
    ↓
Redirected to /login (if not authenticated)
    ↓
Enter username
    ↓
POST /api/auth/login
    ↓
Backend validates against Google Sheet
    ↓
✅ Valid
    ├─ Update login_count in sheet
    ├─ Update last_login timestamp
    ├─ Return user data
    ├─ Store in localStorage
    └─ Redirect based on role:
        ├─ Admin → Dashboard (/)
        └─ Participant → Their detail page (/participant/[name])
```

---

## Access Control

### Admins (ITC Team)
- ✅ Full dashboard access
- ✅ View all participants
- ✅ View all sectors, regions, analytics
- ✅ Full navigation menu

### Participants (Organizations)
- ✅ View only their own detail page
- ✅ See their scores, recommendations, sentiment
- ❌ Cannot see: other participants, dashboard, sector overviews
- ❌ Navigation menu hidden (only logo and logout)

---

## Login Tracking

Every login automatically:
1. Increments `login_count` in Google Sheet (Column E)
2. Updates `last_login` timestamp (Column F)
3. Happens asynchronously (doesn't block login)

**Use Case:** Track which participants are actively using the system

---

## Testing

See `AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for complete testing instructions.

**Quick Test:**
1. Start backend: `cd functions && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd dashboard && npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173`
4. Login as admin: `ajeffries`
5. Login as participant: `capitalfm`

---

## Security Model

**Privacy-Gated System:**
- Simple username-only authentication
- Designed for internal use by known participants
- Focus on privacy and data isolation, not security
- Suitable for: workshop dashboards, assessment reports, internal tools

**Not Suitable For:**
- Public-facing applications
- Sensitive financial/health data
- Applications requiring audit trails
- High-security environments

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Users
1. Open Google Sheet
2. Go to `dashboard_auth` tab
3. Add new row:
   - Column A: Full name/organization
   - Column B: Username (lowercase, no spaces)
   - Column C: "admin" or "participant"
   - Column D: Optional notes
   - Columns E & F: Leave empty (auto-populated on first login)

### Removing Users
1. Open Google Sheet
2. Delete the user's row
3. User cannot login anymore

### Changing Roles
1. Edit Column C: change between "admin" and "participant"
2. User needs to logout and login again for changes to take effect

---

## Analytics

### View Usage Stats

**In Google Sheet:**
- Sort by Column E (login_count) to see most active users
- Sort by Column F (last_login) to see recent activity
- Filter Column E = 0 to see users who never logged in

**Future Enhancement:**
Could create a dashboard page showing:
- Total logins by date
- Most active participants
- Never-logged-in users
- Login trends over time

---

## Future Enhancements

### Easy Wins
- [ ] Add "Remember me" checkbox
- [ ] Session timeout (auto-logout after 1 hour)
- [ ] Welcome message for first-time users
- [ ] Export login analytics as CSV

### Medium Effort
- [ ] Add optional password field
- [ ] Email notifications on login
- [ ] "View as" feature for admins (impersonate participants)
- [ ] Participant dashboard page (custom view)

### Larger Projects
- [ ] Migrate to Firebase Authentication
- [ ] Add user registration flow
- [ ] Granular permissions system
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
