# Benin French Dashboard - Complete Implementation Plan

## Goal
Create a French-language sentiment analysis dashboard for Benin with all reviews translated to French for consistent analysis, plus a small comparison section showing differences between English/French visitor perceptions.

## Data Status

### Current State
- ✅ **30 stakeholders** from Benin "Things to Do"
- ✅ **1,284 total reviews** (well-distributed across stakeholders)
- ✅ **Organized by stakeholder** in `projects/benin/data/prepared_for_analysis/`
- ✅ **Language detection complete** with metadata

### Language Distribution
- English: 706 (55%) - Need translation to French
- French: 302 (24%) - Keep as-is
- Polish: 122 (9.5%) - Need translation to French
- Italian: 104 (8.1%) - Need translation to French
- Portuguese: 25 (2%) - Need translation to French
- German: 11 (0.9%) - Need translation to French
- Spanish: 2 (0.2%) - Need translation to French

**Total to translate**: ~982 reviews (will keep French as-is)

### Year Distribution (2007-2025)
- Peak years: 2018 (213), 2017 (201), 2016 (186)
- Recent: 2023 (39), 2024 (33), 2025 (21)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Translation Setup
We need to use Google Cloud Translation API. The existing translation infrastructure has dependencies we need to handle.

**Options:**
A. Set up translation using existing scripts (requires library install)
B. Use simple API calls with REST
C. Manual translation of sample subset first

**Recommendation**: Let's check your Google Cloud setup

### Step 2: Translate All to French
- Translate ~982 reviews to French
- Estimated cost: $8-12 (at $20 per 1M characters)
- Keep metadata about original language
- All reviews end up in French for harmonized analysis

### Step 3: Run Sentiment Analysis
Using the existing sentiment analysis pipeline:
- Process all French-translated reviews
- Generate theme scores
- Create stakeholder insights
- Output to JSON for dashboard

### Step 4: Create Cross-Language Comparison
Small section showing:
- How English vs French visitors rate themes differently
- Language-specific insights
- Implications for targeted marketing

### Step 5: Dashboard Creation
French-language dashboard showing:
- Sector overview (Benin cultural heritage)
- Theme performance across 9 themes
- Top performers vs improvement areas
- Review quotes (in French)
- **Special section**: English vs French visitor perceptions

## Cost Estimate

### Translation API
- Character count: ~400,000-500,000 characters
- Cost at $20 per 1M characters
- **Estimated: $8-10 total**

### Value Added
- Fully harmonized French analysis
- Cross-language comparison for marketing insights
- Professional French dashboard

## Next Actions

### What We Need From You

1. **Google Cloud Translation API Setup**
   - Is Translation API enabled in your Google Cloud project?
   - Do you have API credentials configured?
   - Or should we use a simpler translation approach?

2. **Confirm Approach**
   - Proceed with Google Cloud Translation?
   - Or prefer a different translation method?
   - Or start with sentiment analysis on mixed languages?

### What I Can Do Now

Without translation dependency, I can:
1. ✅ Show you the current data structure (done)
2. ✅ Prepare sentiment analysis to work with mixed languages
3. ⏭️ Run sentiment analysis on current mixed-language data
4. ⏭️ Create dashboard with language indicators
5. ⏭️ Add translation later when API is ready

## Recommendation

**Proceed in two phases:**

**Phase 1 (Now)**: Run sentiment analysis on mixed-language data to get insights working, with clear language labeling in the dashboard.

**Phase 2 (After API setup)**: Translate everything to French for harmonized analysis + add cross-language comparison section.

This way you get working insights immediately, and can upgrade to fully French + comparison section when ready.
