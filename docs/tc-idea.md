Manifesto: TourismCommons

TourismCommons is a space for sharing, learning, and growing together. We believe tourism can be a force for good—especially when its tools, data, and ideas are open to everyone.

What we stand for

Accessible tools, for all. We build and share free or low-cost tools, templates, and knowledge that emerging destinations, small operators, local communities, and researchers can actually use.

Inclusive research & engagement. Too often research is done on communities, not with them. We commit to stakeholder engagement, listening to voices on the ground, and co-designing solutions.

Transparency & openness. Data, analyses, and findings should be shared openly (respecting privacy / ethics), so that they can be scrutinized, reused, improved.

Practical over perfect. We prefer useful tools, pilots, small wins over waiting for big processes. We learn by doing.

Sustainability in every sense. Environmental, cultural, economic—tourism should respect people, place, heritage. Growth is good, but not at the cost of identity, health, or equity.

Collaboration across sectors. Public, private, academic, local: everyone has something to contribute. мы-we build bridges.

Empowerment. We support capacity building: so that local actors, project leads, community members can not only use tools, but shape future ones.

Mission

To provide a shared platform for free tools, open research, and community-driven tourism development; enabling emerging destinations and stakeholders to enhance competitiveness, foster sustainability, and tell their own stories.
